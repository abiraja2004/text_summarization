secure physical intergroup barrier apology transgressing outgroup reduced threatinduced proximity. third study experimental induction proximity threatening outgroup strengthened relationship collective ingroup identification discriminatory attitude behavioral intentions. study extended previous research showing group imbued threat appeared physical closer among highly identified individual showing distance might mediate relationship intergroup threat discrimination. intergroup barrier attenuates physical proximity study showed group member perception strong versus weak intergroup barrier moderated relationship perceived threat distance judgment. intergroup apology attenuates physical proximity provided evidence strong physical barrier ingroup threatening outgroup protects physical closeness effect intergroup threat showed psychosocial factor apology positive prethreat relation outgroup serve similar function eliminating estimated physical closeness transgressing outgroup. appearing physically close ingroup threatening outgroup elicited expression discriminatory attitude toward member threatening group made people choose sit farther away them.

current study extended work ask whether observed reduction fear specific bird reaction towards human whether handreared starling exhibit generally lower level fear stressful situation involving humans. reduced fear human could arise result specific habituation human presence handling alternatively could reflect reprogramming animal stress responsiveness would affect bird physiological behavioural reaction wide range stressor . light came novel environment test recorded bird latency move immobility defined staying one location without moving foot flying ruffling feather stretching wing wiping bill allowing head movement could exclude latter angle resolution video image. data analysis novel environment novel object test latency move subtracted latency feed wall peck order remove individual difference latency move. novel object test latency peck worm baseline condition subtracted latency test condition remove individual difference motivation feed attributable presence object case resulting difference transformed further. novel environment test origin included betweensubject factor current housing condition excluded environmental enrichment unlikely significant effect early stage one enrichment component present test. order explore data novel environment test performed principal component analysis reduce number dependent variables. result novel environment test glms individual measure test lat lat lat ceilingjumps positionchanges revealed significant effect origin lat wildcaught bird showing shorter latency . found significant effect replicate group analysis providing evidence bird response laboratory environment continuing change month testing. accordance result novel environment test wildcaught bird faster start moving handreared birds. found handreared starling slower start moving novel environment wildcaught bird response novel object different two groups. novel environment test developmental history affected bird latency start moving placed novel cage first time handreared starling slower wildcaught ones. consistent latency start moving also different handreared wildcaught bird novel object test . summary therefore seems plausible difference two group latency start moving primarily driven difference initial escape motivation bird first placed cage wildcaught bird showing higher escape motivation. latency move novel environment test change across four replicate group indicating evidence continuing habituation wildcaught bird month period testing . although find effect replicate group latency move novel object test effect evident handreared wildcaught bird supporting explanation based maturation bird opposed differential habituation laboratory environment. number previous study compared passerine bird response novel environment novel object test aim detecting stable individual difference behaviour indicative personality behavioural syndrome . thus one hand reliability bird three repetition novel object test suggests measure taken reflect stable individual difference . consequently argue latency start moving novel object test mix two motivation fear response causing difference handreared wildcaught bird difference modified exploratory motivation. conclusion found month old handreared starling showed longer latency start moving novel environment wildcaught bird age. thus scientific perspective developmental origin european starling could potentially affect type result obtained experiment bird response novel environment highly stressful situation could factor.

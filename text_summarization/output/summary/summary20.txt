suggestion may important implication context work organization prosocial employee behavior like voluntary helping one supervisor coworkers speaking improve way work organized attempting offer best customer service possible play significant role effective organizational functioning . present research therefore focus interaction internalized moral value selfcontrol depletion predicting voluntary prosocial behaviors. thus expect power likely facilitator selfish state resulting combination depletion low moral identity. result hypothesis regarding threeway interaction effect selfcontrol moral identity employee power voluntary prosocial behavior. argue likely power facilitator selfish state resulting combination low moral identity depletion. combination low moral identity selfcontrol depletion reported increase antisocial behavior considered represent cocktail selfishness power expected magnifying factor. argued possible simply translate result found realm negative behavior positive behavior therefore remains shown whether combination low moral identity depletion lead lower level prosocial behavior power necessary facilitator effect. prosocial behavior easy implement generally sustained societal organizational norm expect people high moral identity act line societal norm irrespective level depletion. indeed research indicates people high power focus moral prosocial value show le antisocial behavior low power . expect prosocial behavior already part daily routine people high moral identity power likely increase helping behavior beyond level. present research expect contrary negative effect depletion low moral identity antisocial behavior power facilitator negative combination depletion low moral identity prosocial behavior. hence expected power facilitates interaction effect depletion moral identity prosocial behavior. particular power level high combination depletion low moral identity lead people refrain prosocial behavior whereas effect expected power level low. present study hypothesis therefore state negative effect depletion prosocial behavior among people low moral identity restricted people high rather low power . test hypothesis thus conducted tobit regression analysis helping behavior predicted depletion manipulation moral identity power manipulation twoway interaction among three variable finally threeway interaction. summary conclusion result study show line theoretical prediction hypothesis among participant felt high power depletion reduced prosocial behavior low moral identity whereas interaction effect depletion moral identity occur felt low power. however given fact interaction moral identity selfcontrol depletion significant among employee low power given obtain result study result analysis interpreted caution. thus seems employee high moral identity moral value readily accessible even selfcontrol resource depleted irrespective power level. general discussion laboratory experiment multisource field study consistently showed interaction depletion moral identity people high power people low power. finding important result indicate especially people feel powerful low moral identity likely show le prosocial behavior result regulatory depletion. importantly present finding offer corroborative evidence idea effect situation constrain cognitive capacity prosocial behavior depends one level moral identity also one sense power. selfcontrol depletion lead decrease prosocial behavior among people low moral identity feel powerful. depletion increase antisocial behavior among people low moral identity irrespective power level. word depletion reduces prosocial behavior among people low moral identity experience power. among people high moral identity selfcontrol depletion power necessarily hamper selfregulation prosocial behavior. employee negative effect selfcontrol depletion prosocial behavior seem apply particularly among low moral identity. situational intervention aimed stimulating moral identity thus likely make employee feel high power behave prosocial ways. another practical implication present finding one hand high power make employee particularly vulnerable effect selfcontrol depletion prosocial behavior hand power also come heavy workload numerous choice decision day. one could assume result employee feel low power vulnerable effect selfcontrol depletion selfish behaviors. finding indicate employee low power depletion reduce prosocial behavior low moral identity. however study realm negative behavior show selfcontrol depletion make people low moral identity likely show antisocial behavior . laboratory experiment permit u draw causal inference regard interactive effect power selfcontrol depletion moral identity prosocial behavior. result also corroborate previous research combined selfcontrol depletion manipulation measure show clear consistency two operationalizations selfcontrol depletion reader could wonder whether situation power may increase prosocial behavior people high moral identity. case prosocial behavior thus likely effortful le socially desirable may result high moral identifier need

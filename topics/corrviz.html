Establishing clinical practice guidelines is crucial to this effort, but their development is a complex task and their quality is directly related to the methodology and source of knowledge used. Objective: We present the design and the evaluation of a tool (KART) that aims to facilitate the creation and maintenance of clinical practice guidelines based on information retrieval techniques. Methods: KART consists of three main modules 1) a literature-based medical knowledge extraction module, which is built upon a specialized question-answering engine; 2) a module to normalize clinical recommendations based on automatic text categorizers; and 3) a module to manage clinical knowledge, which formalizes and stores clinical recommendations for further use. The evaluation of the usability and utility of KART followed the methodology of the cognitive walkthrough. Results: KART was designed and implemented as a standalone web application. The quantitative evaluation of the medical knowledge extraction module showed that 53% of the clinical recommendations generated by KART are consistent with existing clinical guidelines. The user-based evaluation confirmed this result by showing that KART was able to find a relevant antibiotic for half of the clinical scenarios tested. The automatic normalization of the recommendation produced mixed results among end-users. Conclusions: We have developed an innovative approach for the process of clinical guidelines development and maintenance in a context where available knowledge is increasing at a rate that cannot be sustained by humans. In contrast to existing knowledge authoring tools, KART not only provides assistance to normalize, formalize and store clinical recommendations, but also aims to facilitate knowledge building."],"thought_2":["Identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers with clinical and translational utility will require smart experimental strategies that would augment expanding the breadth and depth of molecular measurements within the constraints of currently available technologies. Exosomes represent an information rich matrix to discern novel disease mechanisms that are thought to contribute to pathologies such as dementia and cancer. Although proteomics and transcriptomic studies have been reported using Exosomes-Like Vesicles (ELVs) from different sources, exosomal metabolome characterization and its modulation in health and disease remains to be elucidated. Here we describe methodologies for UPLC-ESI-MS based small molecule profiling of ELVs from human plasma and cell culture media. In this study, we present evidence that indeed ELVs carry a rich metabolome that could not only augment the discovery of low abundance biomarkers but may also help explain the molecular basis of disease progression. This approach could be easily translated to other studies seeking to develop predictive biomarkers that can subsequently be used with simplified targeted approaches."],"prob":["use, studi, can, method, differ, provid, result"],"frex":["approach, understand, conclus, aim, futur, background, advantag"],"lift":["invalu, labori, valuabl, labor-intens, drawback, commonplac, sophist"],"score":["improv, approach, can, use, clinic, method, may"],"proportion":["0.03"]},{"name":["recent, lead, howev, mani, although, may, especi"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[64],"thought_1":["The incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) is increasing at a rapid rate, and has nearly tripled in the United States since 1975 [1–5]. Although some authors maintain that a part of this increase is due to an increase in disease burden [2, 4, 6], others feel that most of this increase is a result of over diagnosis [1, 7–12]. It has been suggested that one of the contributing factors to over-diagnosis is the increasing use of various imaging studies [7]. We have previously shown that 46% of WDTCs are detected by imaging, and that this is not limited to small cancers [13].The rate of obesity has also been steadily increasing in the United States [14]. It has been suggested that patients with an increased body mass index (BMI kg/m2) have a higher incidence of WDTC than patients with normal BMI [15–17]. One might hypothesize that thyroid nodules are more difficult to palpate in obese patients and that as more cancers are detected by imaging the apparent rate of increase in WDTC in obese patients would appear to be greater than in non-obese patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis by determining if there is any difference in the way thyroid cancers are initially detected in obese and non-obese patients."],"thought_2":["Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a neurodegenerative change in the macula at the center of the retina that is closely related to loss of detailed central vision [1]. Population growth, obesity, and widespread adoption of a ‘western type’ of diet may be contributing to the increase of AMD in older people, which is now a worldwide health problem [1,2]. Because of its progressive nature, early identification of possible risk factor(s) is critical for preventing the resulting disability.Macular degeneration is a typical multifactorial disease [2], and complicated interactions between aging, genetic factors, environmental influences, lifestyle changes, and underlying diseases can influence its development and severity [2–4]. Epidemiologic studies show that several chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), characterized by subclinical systemic inflammation, are strongly associated with AMD [5]. In the line of evidences, several experimental studies reveal that oxidative stress-induced inflammatory reactions may play a role in the initiation and progression of AMD [6–8]. Such evidences suggest that increased pro-inflammatory hormones or cytokines can contribute to the development of AMD and that this disease may be a neuronal manifestation of systemic inflammatory responses. However, there is little clinical evidence supporting such association.Iron is an essential mineral for all living cells and participates in a wide array of physiologic functions [9,10]. However, shortage of iron-sequestrating proteins, including ferritin, and inappropriate accumulation of this transition metal are closely related to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, which results in initiation and progression of various non-specific inflammatory responses and neurodegenerative diseases [10–12]. On the other hand, the increased appearance of ferritin in extracellular spaces may be the result of extensive cell damage, and the subsequent breakdown of ferritin could contribute to increased release of sequestrated iron into the blood stream [13]. Moreover, recent reports suggest that ferritin itself is cytotoxic and may inhibit growth in neighboring cells [13,14]. Furthermore, an increase in serum ferritin is closely related to ocular manifestation of systemic inflammatory processes [15]. However, little is known about the association of serum ferritin with macular degeneration. In this study, we aimed to determine whether increased levels of serum ferritin are related to the development of AMD."],"prob":["may, studi, increas, howev, also, associ, report"],"frex":["recent, lead, howev, mani, although, may, especi"],"lift":["world-wid, devast, worldwid, decad, unfortun, nowaday, controversi"],"score":["increas, may, howev, caus, effect, associ, suggest"],"proportion":["0.03"]}],"topic_no":[60,64]},{"name":["gastric, prostat, bladder, colonoscopi, uc, coliti, mucosa"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[28],"thought_1":["Chromoendoscopy with a Standard-Resolution Colonoscope for Evaluation of Rectal Aberrant Crypt Foci"],"thought_2":["Association between Seminal Vesicle Invasion and Prostate Cancer Detection Location after Transrectal Systemic Biopsy among Men Who Underwent Radical Prostatectomy"],"prob":["colon, intestin, prostat, gastric, cervic, oral, bladder"],"frex":["gastric, prostat, bladder, colonoscopi, uc, coliti, mucosa"],"lift":["azoxymethan, polypectomi, bph, fobt, apcmin, colonoscopi, non-ibd"],"score":["prostat, colon, gastric, intestin, cervic, bladder, crc"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["surviv, cancer, tumor, carcinoma, stage, malign, breast"],"children":[{"name":["tumor, breast, cancer, adenocarcinoma, malign, melanoma, carcinoma"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[42],"thought_1":["SPOCK1 Is a Novel Transforming Growth Factor-β–Induced Myoepithelial Marker That Enhances Invasion and Correlates with Poor Prognosis in Breast Cancer"],"thought_2":["Fine-Needle Aspirates CYFRA 21-1 is a Useful Tumor Marker for Detecting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Patients"],"prob":["cancer, tumor, breast, malign, carcinoma, tissu, invas"],"frex":["tumor, breast, cancer, adenocarcinoma, malign, melanoma, carcinoma"],"lift":["basal-lik, fibroadenoma, ctcs, crizotinib, dcis, ros1, eml4-alk"],"score":["cancer, tumor, breast, metastasi, carcinoma, egfr, lung"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["os, pfs, chemotherapi, dfs, prognost, radiotherapi, tnm"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[54],"thought_1":["Upfront Systemic Chemotherapy and Short-Course Radiotherapy with Delayed Surgery for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer with Distant Metastases: Outcomes, Compliance, and Favorable Prognostic Factors"],"thought_2":["Low Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) Predicts Unfavorable Distant Metastasis-Free Survival in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis"],"prob":["surviv, stage, chemotherapi, grade, prognost, recurr, os"],"frex":["os, pfs, chemotherapi, dfs, prognost, radiotherapi, tnm"],"lift":["neoadjuv, recurrence-fre, 3dcrt, oxaliplatin-bas, pn1, her2-target, folfiri"],"score":["surviv, chemotherapi, prognost, os, recurr, stage, pfs"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[42,54]}],"topic_no":[60,64,28,42,54]},{"name":["clinic, patient, hospit, studi, admiss, characterist, diagnosi"],"children":[{"name":["icu, admiss, discharg, stay, admit, sofa, in-hospit"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[9],"thought_1":["Evaluation of Pneumonia Severity and Acute Physiology Scores to Predict ICU Admission and Mortality in Patients Hospitalized for Influenza"],"thought_2":["Predictors of Mortality in Patients Successfully Weaned from Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"],"prob":["hospit, admiss, sever, mortal, pneumonia, discharg, icu"],"frex":["icu, admiss, discharg, stay, admit, sofa, in-hospit"],"lift":["picu, clabsi, icu, mew, readmit, dialysis-requir, micu"],"score":["admiss, hospit, icu, sepsi, pneumonia, mortal, discharg"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["patient, clinic, patient’, diagnosi, follow-up, retrospect, characterist"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[33],"thought_1":["Background and Study Aims: Chronic abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints, but the underlying pathophysiology often remains unknown after routine clinical evaluation.

This connector was previously described for facilitating the attachment of a stainless-steel protective thimble, for the group-housing of post-surgery rodents [17]. The headstage socket was designed using Solid Edge ST6 (Siemens PLM Software) and manufactured using polyamide with selective laser sintering (Beta Layout, Ireland). The socket is a 5 mm high cylinder with an internal/external diameter of 13.5/15.6 mm, respectively (Fig 1A). Two internal feet protrude 2 mm at the base, which allows for attachment to the skull using two stainless-steel mounting screws (0–80 x 1/8; Plastics One; USA). Two 1.2 mm holes were drilled at opposite ends of the headstage socket in order to facilitate attachment of the waterproof wireless system attachment using M1.4x4mm self-tapping electronic screws (Phillips). During normal housing conditions, this waterproof attachment was replaced with a standard 18×9 mm stainless-steel sewing thimble (CKB Ltd; China), which contained 1.2 mm holes drilled at either end for attachment to the headstage socket. A PCB connector was manufactured (PCB-Pool, Ireland) to fit inside the socket, and contains an 18-pin zif connector, two DIP connectors, and an 18-pin electrode connector (A79040-001; Omnetics Connector Corporation) for providing an interface between the implanted electrodes and the wireless recording system. 10.1371/journal.pone.0147730.g001\nFig 1 Photographs of headstage socket, and waterproof thimble attachment.\nA polyamide head-stage socket is shown with its connecting stainless steel thimble and screws, and also a PCB connector which is placed inside during surgery (A). A wireless system attachment was created using electrode connectors, glue, and a sewing thimble (B). Wireless System Attachment\nAn 18×9 mm stainless-steel sewing thimble (CKB Ltd; China) was cut in order to provide an opening at the top and side. A custom-made 3 cm connector was fabricated and contained a 36-pin male connector at one end (A79028-001; Omnetics Connector Corporation), and an 18-pin female connector at the other (A79041-001; Omnetics Connector Corporation). This connector was affixed to the thimble through this drilled opening using a clear 2-part epoxy resin (Araldite; Farnell), such that the W32 wireless system (Multichannel Systems; Reutlingen, Germany) could be plugged into the top of the thimble, and the 18-pin connector could protrude from the base (Fig 1B). Two 7 mm lines were drilled into either end of the thimble at the base using a 1.2 mm drill piece, for allowing the thimble to attach to the headstage socket using M1.4x4mm self-tapping electronic screws (Phillips). A miniature elastic band (~8 mm diameter) was added around the connecting cable to provide damping during animal movement. Furthermore, the 18-pin Omnetics connector was covered around its housing with a 2-part dental cement (Palapress; Heraeus Holding GmbH; Germany), to provide a strong grip for accessing the connector during use. Handling and Habituation\nPrior to surgery, all rats underwent 5 days of handling in order to familiarise them with the experimenter. On days 3–5 rats were placed into the (dry) double-H maze in pairs for 10-minutes/day, in order to familiarise them with the maze environment. Surgery\nThe procedure for implantation followed a similar method used for implantation of the headstage socket [17]. All procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines, which are in compliance with the guidelines of the German Council on Animal Protection (25.5.198) and international (NIH publication no 85–23, revised 1985) laws and policies. All protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Freiburg (permit 35–9185.81/G-13/97). Female Sprague-Dawley rats (300-320g; n = 14) were anaesthetised with oxygen (0.15 l.min-1) and isoflurane (Abbvie, USA); the latter of which was initially set to 4% and gradually lowered to 1.5% after placing the animal into the stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, USA). Animal breathing, reflexes and level of anaesthesia were monitored throughout the duration of the surgery. Animals were implanted with a Teflon-coated platinum iridium wire (140 μm diameter) in the dCA1 region of the hippocampus (AP: -3.6, ML: +2.5; from Bregma, DV: -2.2 from dura matter), and a 16-contact flexible microelectrode (Imtek; Freiburg University) in the left dorsolateral striatum (AP: +0.4, ML: +3.6; from Bregma, DV: -3.7 from dura matter). Prior to implantation, both electrodes were affixed to a 125 μm glass rod using superglue, which provided rigidity and allowed for accurate implantation [18]. In the water-maze recording group (n = 8), two stainless-steel mounting screws (0–80 x 1/8; Plastics One) were used to attach the front and rear feet of the headstage to the anterior and posterior portions of the skull, respectively (Fig 2). The posterior attachment screw (AP: -10.5, ML: +2.5; from Bregma) was pre-soldered to a connecting pin via silver wire (Science Products Gmbh, Germany), and formed the reference/ground electrode connector. Four additional mounting screws were affixed along the edges of the socket on each skull plate to provide further attachment of the implant. The recording and ground electrodes were then affixed to their respective connectors on the PCB, which was inserted into the socket with the 18-pin Omnetics connector facing upwards. A 2-compound dental cement (Palapress; Heraeus Holding GmbH; Germany) was then prepared and used to fill the headstage socket, from its base up to the top of the PCB connector. Two attachment screws were inserted at the front and rear sections of the headstage during this process, and were gradually turned as the cement had hardened, in order to prevent them from sticking to the cement. A headstage socket was not utilised in the control group (n = 6), although these animals had the same electrodes/anchors and PCB connector, which were otherwise mounted in the same position. In both cases care was taken to provide a smooth cement surface along the base of the implant on all sides; such that the skin could heal around the implant. Following surgery animals were given an injection of saline (1 ml i.p.) and placed inside a heated cage to recover. Video footage demonstrating the implantation procedure can be found at http://figshare.com/s/a06fdd80fa2411e4b38b06ec4bbcf141. 10.1371/journal.pone.0147730.g002\nFig 2 Rat skull-implant diagram for the water-maze recording group.\nDiagram showing the location of the headstage socket on the rat’s skull, along with the electrode and anchor positions. Photographs taken during the surgery procedure depict the position of electrodes, socket and anchors (top), and the position of the PCB connector (bottom). The control group received the electrodes, anchors and PCB connector, but no headstage socket. Recovery and Euthanasia\nFollowing surgery, rats were housed individually for 6 days, with the protective stainless-steel thimble disconnected, in order to prevent it from sticking to the blood clot. After 6 days, the protective thimble was attached to the headstage socket, and animals were reunited with their cage-mates. For the first 4 days following surgery, rats were given daily injections of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Caprofen (Carprieve; Norbrook, UK; 4 mg.kg-1 s.c.). Rats were weighed daily during the first 2 weeks, and every 2 days thereafter. No signs of nibbling or damage inflicted to the co-housed animal were observed to the protective thimbles or the skin around it. Instead, the group-housed animals where easier to handle and showed less signs of stress during experiments. Attachment of System and Waterproof Connector\nDuring each test session, the protective stainless-steel thimble was detached from rats, and reattached prior to returning them to their cage. The wireless waterproof connector was prepared by first attaching a wireless recording system (W32; Multichannel Systems) to the top of the waterproof connector. A miniature lithium-polymer battery (35 mAh; digitalo.de GmbH, Germany) was connected to the system and affixed to the side of the waterproof connector using tape (Fig 3A and 3B). A latex finger-cot (Med-Comfort) was folded over the system/connector, and held in place using a miniature elastic band. The system was then attached to the animal by a) connecting the recording cable, and b) affixing the attachment over the headstage socket and securing with screws. Vaseline was applied around the base of the thimble, and the latex finger cot was rolled down over the thimble base (Fig 3C). The system was wirelessly powered down in-between recordings, and remotely activated prior to use, in order to preserve its battery life, which was 30 minutes of continuous stable recording and transmission at 10 KHz sample rate. The total weight of the wireless system, battery, waterproof connector and waterproof coating is approximately 8 g. Following the 4 trials in a single session, the wireless system and connector were detached and the rat was dried and placed under an infra-red heat lamp, prior to returning to their cage. 10.1371/journal.pone.0147730.g003\nFig 3 Photographs of Waterproof Connector.\nThe wireless system connector provides stability for the wireless system, and is shown both without (A) and with (B) the W32 wireless system (Multichannel Systems Gmbh; Germany). With the waterproofing latex finger-cot (C), the rat is able to swim freely about the water maze (D) whilst LFP is transmitted wirelessly. Double-H Water Maze\nThis experiment utilised a procedural-learning variant of the double-H water maze task (see [19]). All rats underwent an initial day of habituation (6 trials), followed by 4 days of training (4 trials / day). During habituation, the water maze was filled to a height of 17 cm, and a 10 cm diameter platform was immersed at the extremity of the NE arm such that it protruded 1 cm above the surface of the water. For each trial, rats were released from the extremity of the S arm, and were given 60 s to swim to the escape platform. Rats that did not find the platform during this time were returned to the starting position, and gently guided to the platform by the experimenter. Upon reaching the platform, rats were given 15 s to consolidate their surroundings, followed by a further 10 s inter-trial delay. During the training sessions, the platform was relocated to the NW arm, and a transparent guillotine door was placed at the entry of the N arm in order to force a right/left turn for rats. Also, the water was rendered opaque by mixing in 250 g skimmed milk powder, and raised to 19 cm such that the platform was hidden 1 cm beneath the water surface. The time taken for rats to reach both the goal arm and platform were noted, alongside the number of initial and repetitive errors. An initial error was counted whenever the rat deviated from the correct swim path into one of the 5 error zones for the first time. A repetitive error was counted if this occurred more than once for each zone.\nThe water maze was surrounded on all sides by high-contrast cues, and a VGA camera (Kinect; Microsoft) was mounted onto the ceiling above the maze for post-task scoring of animal behaviour. Rats in the EEG recording group were given the wireless system plus waterproof attachment before the training and habituation sessions, which was used to record and transmit EEG during two phases of the task (inside the water-maze, on the platform). Additionally, rats underwent 1 minute of pre-task baseline recording, prior to beginning their first trial. For the purpose of video-EEG synchronisation, both recording types were started simultaneously at the beginning of each and every trial inside the maze. The receiver for the wireless system was placed on a shelf which was adjacent to the north side of the maze. Signal Analysis\nBehavioural results, including trial latencies, start/end times and error counting were performed manually using the video data from each rat. EEG data was extracted into Matlab (Mathworks Inc) using NeuroExplorer 4.0 (REF) and was organised into pre-task, maze and platform epochs using custom-written scripts and the timing information from the video recordings. Data arising from the maze was extracted as the 4 seconds prior to the rat reaching the platform. Artefacts were manually removed by combing through the all of the EEG recordings using a 0.25 s sliding window. Artefacts in this case were directly a result of the rat shaking and/or hitting the system on the maze wall, and manifested as a characteristic burst oscillation on the raw EEG trace. The extent of artefact removal was in this case characterised by comparing the lengths of the signals both with and without artefacts. Both the power-spectral density and coherence were computed using custom scripts that were adapted from the Chronux library (http://www.chronux.org); each using 3 orthogonal data tapers, and a 2 s sliding window with 1 s overlap. Power spectral density for each epoch was normalised by dividing by its root-mean-square (RMS) value, and the peak theta-frequency PSD/coherence between 5–12 Hz was extracted for further comparison.\nTheta-gamma cross-frequency modulation was calculated based on a normalised entropy method [16,20] using custom-written Matlab scripts. Signals were decomposed into composite theta phase / gamma envelope signals, by first applying zero-phase delay filters, and then the Hilbert transform; which resulted in a matrix of signals covering each theta and gamma frequency band. The theta phase range was split into 18 × 20° bins, and the instantaneous gamma amplitude at each point in the signal was added to its corresponding theta-phase bin. The resulting histogram of gamma/phase values was normalised, and the signal entropy was then derived for each theta phase bin. The modulation index of each theta/gamma filtered signal pair was then obtained by normalising the entropy result with the maximum possible entropy value; which was taken as log (18). Statistics\nAnalysis of rat behaviour, including initial/repetitive errors and the time taken to reach the goal arm / platform, were analysed using a 2-way ANOVA, looking for significant differences between the test session (1, 2, 3, 4) and rat group (with/without wireless system). Comparisons of theta-frequency PSD and coherence were made using a 1-way ANOVA, which looked for significant differences between the recording arenas (pre-maze, maze, platform). The percentages of the recorded signals after artefact removal were compared using a 1-way ANOVA for each recording electrode, looking for differences between the individual recording sessions. Where significant, each analysis was followed using a Bonferroni multiple comparison test. Each matrix of modulation-index values was compared to a surrogate data distribution (100 surrogates), obtained by taking randomised trial data from randomised rats, and shifting the amplitude of the signals in time to create a composite version of each input signal.

Sample solution was prepared in ultrapure sterilized water and sterilized by filtration immediately before use to minimize any oxidation of the compound. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as-received. Bacterial strains and culture conditions\nC. sakazakii strains ATCC 29544 and ATCC 29004 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Three other C. sakazakii strains (CS 1, CS 2, CS 3) were taken from our laboratory strain collection, which were originally isolated from infant formula and infant rice cereal collected from supermarkets in China. All isolates were used in minimum inhibitory concentration assay and only C. sakazakii ATCC 29544 was used for antimicrobial mechanism analysis. All strains were stored in tryptone soya broth (TSB) with 20% glycerol (v/v) at -80°C. Before each experiment, stock cultures were streaked on tryptone soya agar (TSA) and grew at 37°C for 18 h. Then a loopful of each strain was inoculated into 30 mL TSB and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations\nThe MIC of citral was determined by agar dilution method as described by the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [16] with some modifications. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as a quality control. While determining the antimicrobial activity of citral, ampicillin was used as a positive reference standard for all test strains. The stock antibiotic solutions were prepared in sterile water, then sterilized through a 0.22 μm Acrodisc filter (Gelman, USA). Then TSA was aseptically transferred into sterile 24-well plates containing either citral or the antibiotic. The content (final volume 500 μL) of each well was gently mixed. The final concentrations of citral were 0, 0.07, 0.135, 0.27, 0.41, 0.54, 0.81, and 1.08 mg/mL, and that of ampicillin was 0.1 mg/mL. After hardening, the TSA was spotted with 2 μL (approximately 104 CFU) of the tested bacterium. The spots were left to dry, then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The lowest concentration of citral at which no visible growth of test organisms occurs was defined as the MIC. Growth curves and kinetic parameters\nThe growth curves in TSB at 37°C were determined as previously described [17]. C. sakazakii strain ATCC 29544 was grown to an OD600 value of 0.1 in TSB, then 125 μL of the culture was transferred into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark). Citral was added to the cultures to obtain final concentrations of 1/16MIC, 1/8MIC, 1/4MIC, 1/2MIC, and MIC, and TSB was used as a negative control. Bacteria were further cultured at 37°C, and cell growth was monitored at 600 nm using a multimode plate reader (Tecan, Infinite™ M200 PRO, Männedorf, Switzerland).\nThe model used to fit growth curves to the data as-obtained was comprised of a modified Gompertz equation as follows: ODt=A+(B−A)exp{−exp[−μ(t−M)]} λ=M−(1/μ), and umax=(B−A)μ/e where ODt is optical density at 600 nm (OD600) at time t, t is the time (in hours) that had elapsed since incubation, B is the maximum OD600, A is the initial OD600, M is the time (in hours) of the inflexion point in the exponential phase of model function, μ is the relative growth rate at time M, λis the lag time (i.e., the time until the lag period ended,) and μmax is the maximum growth rate achieved (ΔOD600 per hour.) The model was evaluated for goodness of fit according to the coefficient of determination R2. Intracellular ATP concentrations\nThe method described by Sanchez et al. [18] was followed (with slight modification) to determine intracellular ATP concentration. Briefly, the overnight culture of C. sakazakii strain ATCC 29544 was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g and the supernatant was removed, the cell pellets were washed three times with 0.1 mol/L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0), then the cells were collected by centrifugation under identical conditions. A cell suspension (OD600 = 0.5) made with 50 mL of PBS and 2 mL of the cell suspension was placed into a 2.5 mL Eppendorf tube for citral treatment. Citral was added to each tube to achieve final concentrations of 0 (control), MIC, and 2MIC, respectively. Then the samples were maintained at 37°C for 30 min. To extract the ATP, cells were lysed on ice by ultrasound, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. The top layer was retrieved and stored on ice to prevent ATP loss until measurement. Intracellular ATP was measured with an ATP assay kit (Beyotime Bioengineering Institute, Shanghai, China). After adding 125 μL of ATP assay mix to 125 μL of supernatant in white, opaque, 96-well microtiter plates, the supernatant ATP concentrations were measured with a microplate reader (Tecan, Infinite™ M200 PRO, Männedorf, Switzerland) and recorded as the intracellular ATP concentration. Intracellular pHin measurements\nIntracellular pH was determined according to Breeuwer et al. with slight modification [19]. To load a fluorescent probe in the sample cells, 250 μL of overnight cultures of C. sakazakii strain ATCC 29544 was transferred into TSB (30 mL) and incubated at 37°C for 8 h (approximately OD = 0.6 at 600 nm). Cells were then harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min) and washed twice with 50 mM HEPES buffer (containing 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Then cell pellets were re-suspended in 20 mL of the same buffer. Next, 3.0 μM of the probe, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (cFDA-SE; Molecular Probes, Sigma, Louis, USA), was added. Then cells were incubated for 20 min at 37°C, washed once in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer with 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.0), and re-suspended in 10 mL of buffer. To eliminate non-conjugated cFDA-SE, glucose (10 mM, final concentration) was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C. Finally, cells were washed twice, re-suspended in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.0), and stored on ice.\nAn aliquot of cell suspension labeled by fluorescence was dispensed into tubes with citral at three different concentrations (0, MIC, 2MIC), then transferred into black, opaque, 96-well microtiter plates. After treatment for 20 min, fluorescence intensities were measured under two excitation wavelengths, 440 nm and 490 nm, while the monochromator was rapidly alternated between the wavelengths. The emission was collected at 520 nm, where excitation and emission slit widths were 9 and 20 nm, respectively. The pHin of the bacteria was determined according to the ratio of the fluorescence signal at the pH-sensitive wavelength (490 nm) and the fluorescence signal at the pH-insensitive wavelength (440 nm). All measurements were carried out on a microplate reader (Tecan, Infinite™ M200 PRO, Männedorf, Switzerland). During the assay, the system was maintained at 25°C. The fluorescence of the cell-free controls was deducted from the values of the treated samples.\nCalibration curves were determined for cFDA-SE loaded cells with buffers of different pH. Buffers consisted of glycine (50 mM), citric acid (50 mM), Na2HPO4•2H2O (50 mM), and KCl (50 mM). pH of buffers were adjusted with either NaOH or HCl to various values (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). After equilibration of the pHin and pHout by adding valinomycin (10 μM) and nigericin (10 μM), fluorescence intensity was measured at 25°C. Membrane potentials\nThe methods described by Sanchez et al. was used with slight modification to examine membrane potentials [18]. Briefly, cells were grown in 30 mL of TSB at 37°C to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm, then harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min) and washed twice with PBS (pH 7.0). Next, 125 μL of cell suspensions were placed in black, opaque, 96-well microtiter plates for 30 min at 37°C, then 1 μM of the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent probe bis-(1, 3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4 (3); Molecular Probes, Sigma, Louis, USA) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, followed by addition of citral at three concentrations (0, MIC, 2MIC). Fluorescence was then measured on a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan, Infinite™ M200 PRO, Männedorf, Switzerland) at excitation and emission wavelengths 492 and 515 nm, respectively. The excitation and emission slit widths were 3 and 5 nm, respectively. Background fluorescence resulting from the medium was determined and the results corrected as necessary. Bacterial membrane integrity\nCell membrane integrity was determined according to the method described by Alakomi et al. with slight modification [20], using the LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The overnight culture of C. sakazakii strain ATCC 29544 was harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), then the supernatant was removed and pellets re-suspended in 2 mL of 0.85% NaCl. To acquire viable and non-viable cells, 1 mL of the suspension was added to each of two 50 mL centrifuge tubes containing either 20 mL of 0.85% NaCl (live bacteria) or 20 mL of 70% isopropyl alcohol (dead bacteria). After incubating both samples at room temperature for 1 h (while mixing every 15 min), both samples were pelleted by centrifugation twice at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes, then optical density was adjusted at 600 nm to 0.5 and five viable cells’ proportions (0, 10%, 50%, 90%, and 100%) were mixed to obtain standard samples. A 2X working stain solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI) and adding the mixture into 2 mL of filter-sterilized dH2O.\nCells treated with citral (0, MIC, 2MIC) at 37°C for 15 min were quickly centrifuged (11,000 × g, 1 min), then 100 μL of samples were pipetted in three respective parallel samples into black, opaque, 96-well microtiter plates. Aliquots of 100 μL of the 2X staining solution were then added to each well and mixed completely. The plate was then incubated at 25°C in the dark for 15 min before measurement of the fluorescence of bacterial suspensions with a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan, Infinite™ M200 PRO, Männedorf, Switzerland). The excitation/emission maxima for the dyes were 485/542 nm for SYTO 9 and 485/610 nm for PI. Cell suspension without citral treatment served as the control. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)\nThe FESEM assay was carried out accordingly to a previously published method with slight modification [21]. Cells (OD600 = 0.5) were treated with citral at 0, MIC, and 2MIC, then after being incubated at 37°C for 2 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g, washed twice with PBS (pH 7.0), and re-suspended in water containing 2.5% glutaraldeyde then kept at 4°C for 12 h to fix the cells. After centrifugation, the cells were dehydrated in water-alcohol solutions with different concentrations of alcohol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) for 10 min each. The samples were finally fixed on FESEM supports, sputter-coated with gold under vacuum conditions, and examined under a scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS software (Version 19.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Differences between means were tested by Student’s t-test. Differences were defined as significant at P ≤ 0.05."],"thought_2":["Cell culture and bacterial strains\nThe Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was used as WT [13].

One colony was inoculated into 2 mL of medium and grown 16–18 h (overnight) at 37°C with shaking at 230 rpm in a loosely-capped 15 mL tube. For invasion and replication assays, all overnight cultures were immediately subcultured into 10 mL of the same media in loosely-capped 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated with shaking (230 rpm) at 37°C to late logarithmic phase. LB-grown overnight cultures were diluted 1:33 in LB and incubated for 3.5 h (OD600 of 3.1–4.8). Saccharate M9-grown overnight cultures were diluted 1:17 in saccharate M9 and incubated for 5.25 h (OD600 of 2.5–3.0). The optical density of the cultures was measured at a 1:5 dilution, in order to remain within the linear range, and then multiplied by 5. Promoter activity assays\nOvernight cultures were diluted 1:10 in media, then immediately transferred in triplicate to a 96-well plate in 200 μL volumes. These sub-cultures were maintained shaking at 37°C in an automated plate reader (Tecan Infinite M200) with OD600 and GFP fluorescence readings taken every 15 min over 8 h. To calculate % promoter activity, the maximum GFP intensity achieved was divided by OD600 to normalize for bacterial numbers, and averaged across three experiments. For most experiments, the data was normalized to the condition with the highest promoter activity. Invasion and replication assays\nHeLa cells were seeded at 5x104 on 24-well plastic (Costar) tissue culture-treated plates 20–24 h before infection. Bacteria were grown as detailed above and a gentamicin protection assay was performed, as described previously [7–9]. Briefly, bacteria were added (T0) at an MOI of ~40:1 at 37°C for 10 min before being washed twice in warm 1X Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (no calcium, no magnesium, no phenol red) (Gibco) and replaced with CGM. Thirty minutes post-infection (T30), medium was replaced with CGM supplemented with 50 μg/mL gentamicin and 500 μg/mL histidine for 1 h. Histidine was added because SL1344 is a histidine auxotroph and there can be some restriction of intracellular growth in the absence of supplemental histidine [16]. At 1.5 h post-infection, medium was replaced with medium containing 10 μg/mL gentamicin and 500 μg/mL histidine. For invasion assays, invasion was calculated at 1.5 h post-infection. At 1.5, 4, 6 and 8 h post-infection, cells were lysed with 0.2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate in PBS and diluted serially in PBS for plating on LB agar. Flow cytometry\nPprgH-gfp bacteria grown overnight and subcultured in 10 mL LB or saccharate M9, as detailed above, were washed once by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 2 min, resuspended in HBSS, and 10 μL LB-grown or 20 μL M9-grown bacteria were fixed in 500 μL of 2.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min. Bacteria were washed twice in PBS and incubated with Syto41 (Life Technologies) at 1:500 for 30 min in the dark. Stained bacteria were washed in PBS and subsequently resuspended in 1 mL PBS for analysis on a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Samples were gated on Syto41+ events, and the % of GFP+ events was measured. Graphs of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were made using GraphPad Prism, and mean ± S.D. was plotted from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. All analyses were conducted on three independent experiments, and the mean ± S.D. was calculated.

The complete chloroplast (cp) genome sequence of Salvia miltiorrhiza, the first sequenced member of the Lamiaceae family, is reported here. The genome is 151,328 bp in length and exhibits a typical quadripartite structure of the large (LSC, 82,695 bp) and small (SSC, 17,555 bp) single-copy regions, separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs, 25,539 bp). It contains 114 unique genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs and four rRNAs. The genome structure, gene order, GC content and codon usage are similar to the typical angiosperm cp genomes. Four forward, three inverted and seven tandem repeats were detected in the Salvia miltiorrhiza cp genome. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis among the 30 asterid cp genomes revealed that most SSRs are AT-rich, which contribute to the overall AT richness of these cp genomes. Additionally, fewer SSRs are distributed in the protein-coding sequences compared to the non-coding regions, indicating an uneven distribution of SSRs within the cp genomes. Entire cp genome comparison of Salvia miltiorrhiza and three other Lamiales cp genomes showed a high degree of sequence similarity and a relatively high divergence of intergenic spacers. Sequence divergence analysis discovered the ten most divergent and ten most conserved genes as well as their length variation, which will be helpful for phylogenetic studies in asterids. Our analysis also supports that both regional and functional constraints affect gene sequence evolution. Further, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a sister relationship between Salvia miltiorrhiza and Sesamum indicum.

Primers were designed by Primer3 (v.0.4.0) software with melting temperatures (Tms) of 67–72°C, which are optimal for the NBS SYBR Green I Real-time PCR Master Mix (NanoBioSys Inc., Korea). Two primer sets were used for the real-time PCR assay. The first had the following sequences: 5′- GCT GGA TCC TGG GAA ATC CAG AGT G-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTT CGA GTC ATG ATT GGG CCA TGA A-3′ (reverse primer). The other was provided by Dr. H.P. (unpublished data). The nucleotide sequences amplified by the above primers were synthesized or amplified to generate DNA templates for use as positive controls in the real-time PCR assay. Synthesized nucleotide sequences were cloned into a pUC57 vector with BamHI and ApaI restriction enzyme sites (Cosmo Genetech Co. Ltd., Korea). The amplified full sequence of the HA gene segment was cloned into a pSC-A-amp/kan vector (Stratagene, USA). This was performed by RT-PCR as previously described [35]. Briefly, 1 µg of total viral RNA was reverse transcribed using 20 pmol of a gene-specific primer (5′-AGC RAA AGC AGG-3′) at 50°C for 90 min.

RNA transcript was further purified with the Total RNA Isolation kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Germany) and quantified with spectrophotometer at 260 nm. in vitro transcribed RNA was serially diluted and reversed transcribed for the determination of detection limits. Ethics Approval for the use of swab samples for this study was obtained from the Wonkwang University Hospital Institutional Review Board (Approval No. WKUHIRB). Written informed consent was obtained from patients involved in this study, and the study was approved by the ethics committee (director, Eun-Taik Jeong, M.D., Ph.D.). Clinical specimens and sample processing Nasopharyngeal swab specimens of influenza A/H1N1 were obtained from Wonkwang University Hospital. Influenza infections were confirmed using commercially-available PCR assays (Bioneer Inc. Korea and Seegene Inc. Korea). For each swab sample, RNA was extracted with the Total RNA Isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Germany). RT-PCR was performed either with the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo, Japan) or the SuperScript III First-strand cDNA Synthesis system (Invitrogen™, USA) to obtain cDNA from the extracted RNA. Microfluidic LabChip real-time PCR based on SYBR green Polymeric injection-molded top-side PC plate was fabricated with inlet and outlet. Bottom-side flat PC plate was fabricated using metal mold and injection-molding machine. Both PC plates were attached using adhesive tape to generate microfluidic channels. Total viral RNAs isolated from swap samples were used for the synthesis of cDNA by reverse transcription as manufacturer's protocol (See above, “Sample processing”). Subsequently, real-time PCR reaction was prepared using NBS SYBR Green I Real-Time PCR Master Mix Kit (NanoBioSys Inc., Korea). 10–20% (v/v) of synthesized cDNA and 1 µM of each primer were added, and 15 µL reaction mixture was loaded into each channel of LabChip. LabChip filled with reaction mixture was placed onto the LabChip case and further injected into the ultra-fast LabChip real-time PCR G2–3 system (NanoBioSys Inc., Korea). According to software protocol (pre-denaturation at 95°C for 8 s then 30 cycles at 95°C for 8 s and 72°C for 14 s), real-time PCR was performed. As real-time PCR proceeded, real-time data were plotted on the screen and then sigmoidal curves for amplified pathogen DNAs were appeared. After curve fitting, Ct values and reaction time of real-time PCR were appeared on the screen. It took 15 min for 30 cycles of real-time PCR. Each reaction included the no template control (NTC) to determine whether it was positive or negative. A sample with a Ct value less than 31 was considered positive in cases where the Ct value of the NTC (No Template Control) was not assigned. Traditional real-time PCR based on SYBR green Real-time PCR was performed using the NBS SYBR Green I Real-Time PCR Master Mix Kit (NanoBioSys Inc., Korea).

Genomic DNA isolation The QIAamp DNA mini kit was used to extract DNA from cervical specimen and the genomic DNA was eluted in 50 µl of elution buffer. The quality of the extracted DNA was checked by conventional PCR to amplify a housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in a 50 µl of reaction containing 5 µl of 10× PCR buffer (20 mM MgCl2), 2 µl of 10 mM dNTP, 0.5 µl of McTaq DNA polymerase (5 U/µl), 2 µl of 5 µM forward primer GAPDH-F, 2 µl of 5 µM reverse primer GAPDH-R (Table 1) and 2 µl of template DNA.

Clinical DNA samples were subjected to EasyChip assay platform for HPV genotyping. The details of HPV blot format and typing procedure were described previously [37]. Briefly, 20 µl of the denatured amplicon was hybridized to the blot and the genotype was determined using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and substrate. After the blot was dried, the HPV genotypes displayed on the blot were determined using a standard visual assessment protocol. Plasmid construction of L1 fragment from various HPV genotypes Partial HPV L1 region was amplified by PCR using the clinical DNA samples of HPV16, 18, 39, 45, 52, 56, 58 and 68 and the primer pair FRG5/FRG2 (Table 1).

Symmetric and asymmetric broad-range real-time PCR and HRM analysis For symmetric amplification of the HPV genomic DNA, broad-range real-time PCR was performed in a 384-well format using LightCycler 480. Briefly, the PCR reaction (20 µl) was composed of 10 µl of 2× HRM master mix, 2 µl of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.8 µl of 5 µM forward primer FRG5, 0.8 µl of 5 µM reverse primer FRG2, and 2 µl of template DNA. The amplification condition was optimized for the use of FastStart Taq DNA polymerase by incubating the reaction mixtures at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 46°C for 20 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec with the ramp to 95°C at 4.8°C/s, to 46°C at 2.5°C/s, and to 72°C at 4.8°C/s.

An additional 1 min at 72°C was added to replenish PCR product. For HRM analysis, the PCR product was denatured by rising temperature to 95°C at 4.8°C/s and was then cool down to 55°C at 2.5°C/s for hybridization. The melting curve was acquired by increasing the temperature from 55°C to 95°C at a ramp rate of 4.8°C/s with 25 acquisitions per degree of temperature."],"prob":["use, pcr, dna, sampl, primer, c, rna"],"frex":["primer, qiagen, biosystem, pcr, taq, qiaamp, anneal"],"lift":["3130xl, klenow, genescan, ggg, qubit, gta, qiaquick"],"score":["primer, pcr, dna, rna, qiagen, biosystem, sequenc"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[11,38]},{"name":["mutat, brca1, cnvs, methyl, exon, exom, brca2"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[79],"thought_1":["We report molecular genetic analysis of 42 affected individuals referred with a diagnosis of aniridia who previously screened as negative for intragenic PAX6 mutations. Of these 42, the diagnoses were 31 individuals with aniridia and 11 individuals referred with a diagnosis of Gillespie syndrome (iris hypoplasia, ataxia and mild to moderate developmental delay). Array-based comparative genomic hybridization identified six whole gene deletions: four encompassing PAX6 and two encompassing FOXC1. Six deletions with plausible cis-regulatory effects were identified: five that were 3ʹ (telomeric) to PAX6 and one within a gene desert 5ʹ (telomeric) to PITX2. Sequence analysis of the FOXC1 and PITX2 coding regions identified two plausibly pathogenic de novo FOXC1 missense mutations (p.Pro79Thr and p.Leu101Pro). No intragenic mutations were detected in PITX2. FISH mapping in an individual with Gillespie-like syndrome with an apparently balanced X;11 reciprocal translocation revealed disruption of a gene at each breakpoint: ARHGAP6 on the X chromosome and PHF21A on chromosome 11. In the other individuals with Gillespie syndrome no mutations were identified in either of these genes, or in HCCS which lies close to the Xp breakpoint. Disruption of PHF21A has previously been implicated in the causation of intellectual disability (but not aniridia). Plausibly causative mutations were identified in 15 out of 42 individuals (12/32 aniridia; 3/11 Gillespie syndrome). Fourteen of these mutations presented in the known aniridia genes; PAX6, FOXC1 and PITX2.

Forty-nine (79.0%) of S. enterica Typhimurium isolates were positive for blaTEM-1b and resistant to ampicillin. Thirteen S. enterica Typhimurium isolates (21.0%) were positive for blaCTX-M-1-group and blaCTX-M-9-group, and all isolates harboring blaCTX-M genes were positive for ISEcp1. Two main clones (PFGE type A and D) accounted for nearly 70% of S. enterica Typhimurium isolates, and 7 CTX-M-producing isolates belonged to PFGE type D. Collectively, our data reveal multi-drug resistance and a high prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamases among S. enterica Typhimurium isolates from children in China. In addition, we report the first identification of blaCTX-M-55 within Salmonella spp. Our data also suggest that clonal spread is responsible for the dissemination of S. enterica Typhimurium isolates."],"thought_2":["Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been an important pathogen causing bloodstream infections. Our study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and genetic diversity of clinical S. aureus isolates from patients with bloodstream infection in four hospitals of Shanghai from 2009 to 2011. Methods: A collection of S. aureus isolates causing bloodstream infection from four hospitals in the central part of Shanghai was carried out. Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of collected isolates were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and spa-type, multi-locus sequence typing, agr type and toxin gene profiling were performed to explore the molecular diversity. Moreover, MRSA strains were also characterized by Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. Results: The drugs such as linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin were efficacious for treating S. aureus including MRSA bloodstream infection. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains displayed distinct diversity in molecular characterization and toxin genes, and three virulent MSSA strains encoding at least five toxins were detected. Five community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains were found, but the majority (88.7%) of MRSA strains belonged to two epidemic clones (ST239-MRSA- III and ST5-MRSA- II) with different toxin gene profiles among patients with bloodstream infection. Conclusions: Healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains were still the main pathogen causing bloodstream infections in spite of the emergence of CA-MRSA strains in hospital setting."],"prob":["isol,

Euoplocephalus tutus\nThe skull of Euoplocephalus tutus has been described and illustrated by several authors [4], [7], [11]–[17], and so only new observations of variable features are provided here. Descriptions of the postcrania of Euoplocephalus tutus by Coombs [6]–[10], Carpenter [3], Penkalski [13], and Arbour et al. [24] include information on most, but not all, aspects of the postcranial skeleton; in particular, the pre-caudal vertebral series has received relatively little attention. As such, more detailed descriptions and comparisons of the postcrania of specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus are presented. These descriptions include newly collected or newly prepared specimens in the TMP and UALVP collections, as well as a review of previously published specimens. Cranium\nSkulls referred to Euoplocephalus tutus (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Figs. S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S16, S17, S18, S19, Tables S2 and S3) have received a great deal of attention in the literature, but less attention has been paid to the shapes and patterns of the cranial caputegulae. Examination of 22 complete or partial skulls, and numerous cranial fragments (such as isolated quadratojugal horns or small skull fragments), shows that some caputegulae are consistent in form and location, and homologies can be proposed for these elements (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). These include the supranarial (sensu 16), postnarial, median nasal, loreal (anterior to the orbit, e.g. 56), prefrontal, supraorbital, and nuchal caputegulae, and the squamosal and quadratojugal horns. The arched supranarial caputegulae form the rim of the external nares, and are usually more rugose than the other caputegulae. The postnarial caputegulae are paired, subrectangular, flat caputegulae posterior to the supranarial caputegulae. Posterior to the postnarial caputegulae, and centered on the midline of the skull, is the large, hexagonal, median nasal caputegulum. A large, keeled caputegulum posterior to the postnarial caputegulae (loreal caputegulum) forms the lateral edge of the snout and extends onto the dorsal surface of the skull. A similar caputegulum is found posterior to the loreal caputegulum, on the lacrimal, but this does not extend as far onto the dorsum. There are two supraorbital caputegulae, an anterior one and a posterior one, each of which is triangular in dorsal view and has a keel approximately in line with the keel of the squamosal horn. The supraorbital caputegulae do not have distinct peaks, but instead the lateral keel of each forms a continuous edge with the adjacent supraorbital. The posterior supraorbitals of TMP 1991.127.1 (Fig. 3, Fig. S7) and UALVP 31 (Fig. 3, Fig. S2) each have a prominent transversely-oriented sulcus, which is not visible on any other specimens. In lateral view, the posterior supraorbitals of TMP 1991.127.1 (Fig. 5, Fig. S7) and UALVP 31 (Fig. 5, Fig. S7) are prominent and triangular. In each specimen, the posterior supraorbital is lower and more rounded.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g003Figure 3\nSkulls in dorsal view.\nCMN 0210 is the holotype of Euoplocephalus tutus, CMN 8530 is the holotype of Anodontosaurus lambei, MOR 433 is the holotype of Oohkotokia horneri, and ROM 784 is the holotype of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus.

The frontals and nasals are completely obscured by the frontonasal caputegulae (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Each skull referred to Euoplocephalus has a unique pattern of frontonasal caputegulae, which are generally subcircular, hexagonal, or subrectangular. The posterior extents of distinct caputegulae vary between individual specimens, but in most specimens individual caputegulae are not visible in the parietal regions posterior to the supraorbitals. The nuchal caputegulae can also vary in size and shape; usually, there are four square-to-rectangular caputegulae, and the median pair is smaller than the lateral pair (Figs. 3, 4). The squamosal horn is one of the most variable features on the skull in specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus, but is generally triangular in dorsal and lateral views (Figs. 3, 4). The length and sharpness of the squamosal horn varies, as does the angle at which the squamosal horn projects from the skull. The longest, most pointed squamosal horns are found in FPDM V-31, MOR 433, NSM PV 20381, TMP 2001.42.19, and USNM 11892 (Fig. 5, Figs. S5, S6, S9). TMP 1991.127.1 (Fig. 5, Fig. S7) and UALVP 31 (Fig. 5, Fig. S2) have pointed squamosal horns that are relatively shorter, whereas the shortest, bluntest squamosal horns are found in AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5403 (Fig. 5, Figs. S10, S11). In dorsal view, the posterior edge of the squamosal horn is nearly continuous with the nuchal crest in some specimens (ROM 832, TMP 1997.59.1, TMP 1997.132.1; Figs. 3–4, Figs. S8, S12, S13). In other skulls (AMNH 5337, AMNH 5405, ROM 1930; Figs. 3–4, Fig. S10, S14, S15), the squamosal horn is distinct from the nuchal crest in dorsal view. The squamosal horns of FPDM V-31, MOR 433, NSM PV 20381, TMP 2001.42.19, and USNM 11892 (Fig. 5, Figs. S5, S6, S9) are back-swept, i.e., a line drawn from the center of the base of the squamosal horn through the apex of the horn in lateral view is more horizontal in these specimens compared to other referred Euoplocephalus specimens like ROM 1930 or UALVP 31 (Fig. 5, Figs. S2, S15). The squamosal horns extend well past the nuchal caputegulae in FPDM V-31, MOR 433, NSM PV 20381, TMP 2001.42.19, and USNM 11892 (Fig. 3, Figs. S5, S6, S9), a condition more similar to that observed in Ankylosaurus than in other specimens referred to Euoplocephalus. The quadratojugal horn also varies considerably in terms of size, sharpness, and angle of projection from the skull. In dorsal and lateral views, the apex of the quadratojugal horn may be sharp (AMNH 5405, TMP 1991.127.1, UALVP 31; Figs. 3, 4, 5, Figs. S2, S7, S14) or round (CMN 8530, NHMUK R4947; Figs. 3, 4, 5, Figs. S4, S16). The apex may be centrally positioned, so that the quadratojugal horn is an equilateral triangle in dorsal or lateral view (AMNH 5405, TMP 1991.127.1, UALVP 31; Figs. 3, 4, 5, Figs. S2, S7, S14), or posteriorly offset, so that the horn is a right-angle triangle (ROM 832, TMP 1997.132.1, USNM 11892; Figs. 3, 4, 5, Figs. S5, S8, S12). The orientations of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns are likely controlled by the taphonomic deformation of the skulls [31]. Some specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus have small circular caputegulae at the bases of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns postocular caputegulae (CMN 8530, TMP 1997.132.1; Fig. 5), and other specimens lack these caputegulae (AMNH 5405, UALVP 31; Fig. 5). The shape of the posterior edge of the nuchal crest in dorsal view varies among specimens referred to Euoplocephalus (Figs. 3, 4). In most specimens, shallow notches separate the medial pairs of nuchal caputegulae (AMNH 5238, AMNH 5405, TMP 1991.127.1; Figs. S7, S14, S17). In other specimens, the posterior edges of the nuchal crests are straight (ROM 832, TMP 1997.59.1, TMP 1997.132.1; Figs. S8, S12, S13), as they are in Dyoplosaurus (ROM 784; Fig. S3). AMNH 5405 and TMP 1991.127.1 have arched skulls in lateral view (Fig. 5, Figs. S7, S14), but in other specimens (AMNH 5403, CMN 8530, MOR 433; Fig. 5, Figs. S4, S6, S11) the anterodorsal profiles of the skulls are nearly flat. It is likely, but not certain, that these differences are the results of taphonomic deformation [31]. Posterior to the orbits, the parietal region varies from flat to concave in lateral profile.\nCranial sutures are generally undetectable in adult ankylosaurids [37]. Although cranial sutures on the dorsum are obliterated by ornamentation in all referred Euoplocephalus skulls, sutures are occasionally visible on the ventral surfaces of some specimens. For example, the contacts between the premaxilla and maxilla, pterygoid and palatine, pterygoid and quadrate, and quadrate and quadratojugal are visible in AMNH 5405 (Fig. 6B). In the palatal region (Fig. 6A, B, D, E), a longitudinal furrow at the midline between the paired premaxillae may be present or absent. Some specimens have depressions lateral to the palatal apertures.\nThe skull of ROM 784 has been prepared recently to expose the ventral surface of the skull roof, which has never been described (Fig. 6G). Both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the skull have been eroded, including the braincase. Ciliary osteoderms are preserved adjacent to the dorsal surface of the orbital cavity. Ciliary osteoderms are also preserved in AMNH 5238, AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, AMNH 5404, and AMNH 5405 [12],[57]. Mandible\nThe mandible of Euoplocephalus is described in detail by Vickaryous and Russell 16. Much of the variation in mandibular morphology in specimens referred to Euoplocephalus (Fig. 6I–L) results from taphonomic distortion. The mandible of AMNH 5403 is much lower and flatter than those of AMNH 5337, AMNH 5405, and UALVP 31, but the cranium of AMNH 5403 has clearly been taphonomically crushed. The coronoid projects markedly from the dorsal border of the mandible in UALVP 31 (Fig. 6I, J), but not in AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403 (Fig. 6L), or AMNH 5405 (Fig. 6K). The significance of this difference is unclear, but does not appear to be taphonomically related, as the coronoid is not abraded in AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, or AMNH 5405, and AMNH 5405 does not appear taphonomically distorted. Vertebral Column\nAssociated cervical vertebrae (Fig. 7, Table S4) are only preserved in AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, and NHMUK R5161. The cervicals of AMNH 5403 are taphonomically distorted and asymmetrical. The cervicals are only partly visible in dorsal view in NHMUK R5161 as this specimen is displayed as a panel mount.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g007Figure 7\nCervical and dorsal vertebrae.\nAMNH 5403 axis (A1) in anterior, left lateral, and dorsal views; cervical (B1) in anterior, right lateral, and dorsal views; cervical (C1) in posterior, left lateral, views; cervical (D1) in anterior, left lateral views. AMNH 5337 cervical (A2) in posterior, right lateral views; dorsals (B2,C2) in anterior, right lateral, and dorsal views. UALVP 31 axis (A3) in left lateral view, and cervical (B3) in posterior view. Abbreviations: c, centrum; cr, cervical rib; di, diapophysis; ns, neural spine; na, neural arch; nc, neural canal; od, odontoid; pa, parapophysis; poz, postzygapophysis; prz, prezygapophysis. The atlas is unknown for Euoplocephalus tutus, but an axis is preserved in AMNH 5403 (Fig. 7). The axial centrum is anteroposteriorly longer than those of other cervical centra in AMNH 5403. The odontoid is wide and massive, with a shallow U-shaped trough on the dorsal surface. Cervical ribs are fused to the centrum; because of extensive plaster reconstruction it is unclear if the ribs are dichocephalic or holocephalic. In dorsal view, the neural spine is V-shaped, with the arms of the V directed posteriorly. The neural spine slopes dorsoposteriorly. Prezygapophyses are not preserved. The large postzygapophyses are located on the posterolateral ends of the V-shaped neural spine, and overhang the posterior end of the centrum. The articular faces of the postzygapophyses are oval and anteroposteriorly long.\nOne posterior cervical is preserved in AMNH 5337 (Fig. 7), and three postaxial cervicals are preserved in AMNH 5403 (Fig. 7). The cervical centra are wider than long or approximately as long as wide, with subcircular to elliptical amphicoelus articular faces. The position of the anterior face relative to the posterior face (dorsal or ventral to, or in line with) varies among the three vertebrae. The neural spine is transversely oriented and is U-shaped in dorsal view. In anterior view, the neural spine is an inverted triangle. Although partly damaged in all specimens, a thin horizontal sheet of bone, of unknown anterior extent, occurred between the widely-separated prezygapophyses. The prezygapophyses overhang the anterior edge of the centrum (unlike the postzygapophyses, which do not overhang the posterior edge of the centrum). There are no epipophyses. The neural canal is square in cross-section. The transverse process is low on the neural arch and projects ventrolaterally. The parapophysis is a subcircular protuberance positioned anteriorly on the centrum, although the dorsoventral position varies. Variation in the position of the articular faces relative to each other, the positions and sizes of the transverse processes (diapophyses), and the proportions of the centra in AMNH 5403 reflect positional differences along the vertebral column. AMNH 5337 preserves the most complete presacral vertebral series of any specimen referred to Euoplocephalus tutus, and includes the final cervical vertebra (Fig. 7B1), eleven free dorsals (Figs. 7B2–3, 8), four dorsosacrals (dorsals incorporated into the sacral rod of the pelvis, with fused centra and neural spines), three sacrals, and one caudosacral. The parapophysis is located at the junction between the neural arch and centrum on one of the vertebrae (Fig. 7B2), and is transitional between the cervical and dorsal vertebrae; it is here considered as a dorsal vertebra because the morphology of the neural spine is more similar to those of the dorsals than cervicals. In addition to the location of the parapophysis, the dorsal vertebrae (Fig. 8, Table S4) can be differentiated from the cervicals based on morphological differences of the neural spines, which are anteroposteriorly-oriented and blade-like in the dorsals (rather than transversely-oriented and U-shaped, as in the cervicals). The shapes of the dorsal neural spines vary along the vertebral column; each is a mediolaterally thin and rectangular (in lateral view) plate that overhangs the posterior edge of the centrum. A rugose, mediolateral swelling occurs towards the distal end of the neural spine. The dorsal centrum is spool-shaped, with concave lateral sides and circular articular faces. The neural canal is tall and elliptical. The transverse processes are mediolaterally wide and anteroposteriorly long. The orientation at which they project from the neural arch varies from horizontal to dorsolateral. In some vertebrae, paired fossae occur at the junctions of the transverse processes, neural spines, and prezygapophyses (Fig. 7C2). The diapophysis is an inverted triangle on the end of the transverse process. The parapophysis is a subcircular to teardrop-shape articular surface in the anterior dorsals and sutural surface in the posterior dorsals. Posteriorly in the vertebral series, the dorsal ribs fuse to the dorsal vertebrae. The prezygapophyses are closely set and steeply angled, forming a U-shaped trough. The postzygapophyses are fused together along their lengths to form a peg-like, midline structure.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g008Figure 8\nDorsal vertebrae of AMNH 5337.\nAMNH 5337, D in anterior and left lateral views; E in posterior and right lateral views; F in anterior and right lateral views; G in anterior and right lateral views; H in posterior and left lateral views; I to L in anterior and left lateral views. Abbreviations: c, centrum; di, diapophysis; na, neural arch; nc, neural canal; ns, neural spine; pa, parapophysis; poz, postzygapophysis; prz, prezygapophysis; r, rib; tp, transverse process. Features that vary among the dorsal vertebrae include the angles of projection of the transverse processes (more steeply inclined posteriorly in the series), the extents that the neural spines and postzygapophyses overhang the posterior ends of the centra (more overhanging posteriorly in the series), and whether or not the ribs are coossified to the transverse processes (unfused anteriorly, and fused posteriorly in the series). Because only one specimen preserves a relatively complete dorsal series (AMNH 5337), it is impossible to compare vertebrae in the same positions in different specimens; the dorsals of AMNH 5337 are similar in most respects, other than size, to those of Ankylosaurus [39]. Coombs [9], in describing the juvenile specimen AMNH 5266, noted that the dorsal centra were not as constricted midlength relative to the articular faces as in other Euoplocephalus tutus specimens, a difference he attributed to ontogenetic change. It is unknown at present how vertebral morphology may change throughout ontogeny in ankylosaurids. Additionally, Coombs [9] noted that the diapophyses of the preserved dorsal neural arch were less blade-like compared to Ankylosaurus magniventris and other Euoplocephalus tutus specimens. The synsacrum (Figs. 9, 10, Table S5) includes coossified dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae. Currently, only the sacra of AMNH 5245, NHMUK R5161, and ROM 1930 can be observed in ventral view, as all of the other pelves are mounted for display with only the dorsal surface accessible. A full description of the pelvis of specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus is provided by Coombs [8]. Vickaryous et al. (2004) and Thompson et al. [32], only noted the presence or absence of the synsacrum, but did not fully describe it. Where sacral vertebrae are preserved, they are always coossified, except for AMNH 5266, a juvenile specimen [9]. The number of dorsosacrals and caudosacrals is variable. True sacrals are identified here as those that immediately bracket the acetabulum, and in all referred specimens there appear to have been no more than three. AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 each have four dorsosacrals, three sacrals, and one caudosacral. AMNH 5245 has two dorsosacrals, three sacrals, and one caudosacral, but the anterior end of the sacrum is broken and there were almost certainly additional dorsosacrals. The sacrum of ROM 1930 is in several pieces, but includes a block of five coossified vertebrae (with a sixth broken off), which appear to be dorsosacrals based on the flattened, T-shaped ribs (Fig. 9A, B). The most anterior vertebra in this section has free, unfused prezygapophyses, which indicates that this is the first vertebra in the fused sacral rod. The most posterior vertebra preserved in this section may be a sacral vertebra. A second section of fused vertebrae consists of two vertebrae that are most likely sacral vertebrae, based on the morphology of the centra and the large broken area representing the attachments of the sacral ribs. These two sections do not fit back together, so it is unclear if an additional vertebra is missing between them. In total, at least seven dorsosacral and sacral vertebrae formed the sacral rod of ROM 1930. There are an additional three unfused caudosacral vertebrae in ROM 1930 (Fig. 9 G–J). The distal ends of the transverse processes are large, not tapering, which suggests they contacted or fused with the ilia. This specimen also has three loose vertebrae, one of which is probably a true sacral, and two of which are probably caudosacrals. ROM 1930 may have had up to eleven vertebrae in the pelvis. NHMUK R5161 includes at least three dorsosacrals, three sacrals and three caudosacrals (see [21]:Pl. VI, Fig. 2). TMP 1982.9.3 preserves four dorsosacrals and two sacrals, with the posterior portion of the sacral rod broken (Fig. 10P).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g009Figure 9\nDorsosacral, sacral, caudosacral, and caudal vertebrae.\nPartial sacrum of ROM 1930 in A) left lateral and B) dorsal (with anterior to the right) views.

The intervertebral facets of centra of all of the dorsosacral and sacral vertebrae are coossified in adult specimens (unfused sacral vertebrae are known in the juvenile specimen AMNH 5266), but the centra of the caudosacral vertebrae may not be coossified. The neural spines of all of the vertebrae of the sacrum fuse into a single continuous sheet of bone, such that the prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses become indistinct. In TMP 1982.9.3, the distal ends of the neural spines are laterally expanded, forming a flat to slightly concave dorsal surface (Fig. 10P). Although the neural spines are completely coossifed in ROM 1930, in dorsal view the individual neural spines form a repeating teardrop pattern (Fig. 9B). This region is unprepared in AMNH 5245, somewhat reconstructed with plaster in both AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409, and obscured by skin impressions in NHMUK R5161. The centra of the dorsosacrals have lateral surfaces that are slightly more concave compared to the centra of the sacrals. Ventrally, the sacral vertebrae lack a midline groove (AMNH 5245) or have a shallow, discontinuous midline groove (ROM 1930). The transverse processes of the dorsosacrals are T-shaped in cross section, whereas those of the sacrals are more rectangular, and proportionately thicker in cross-section.\nArbour et al. [24] noted differences in the shapes of centra among caudal vertebrae referred to Euoplocephalus tutus, with most specimens having circular to subcircular cross-sections, and CMN 8530 being octagonal (Fig. 9K). Features of the caudal vertebrae (Fig. 9, Tables S5, S6) that do not appear to vary among specimens include the orientations of the neural and haemal spines, and the shapes of the neural and haemal spines (in all instances, the spines taper distally and are blade-like). The presence or absence of a notochordal prominence on the centrum varies among vertebrae within a single individual. The number of vertebrae incorporated into the tail club handle (terminology sensu [10]) may be a useful character, but few tail clubs are complete and this character cannot be coded in most specimens.\nPenkalski [13] observed differences in the orientations of the articular faces of the zygapophyses in the caudal vertebrae, with ROM 784 (Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus) having more horizontal articular faces than those of AMNH 5404. However, the orientations of the articular faces vary along the caudal series in ROM 784, and the posterior caudals have more vertically oriented zygapophyseal articular faces. Pectoral Girdle And Forelimb\nAll scapulae referred to Euoplocephalus tutus are dorsoventrally broad and paddle-shaped (Fig. 10A–G, Table S7). The posterior (distal) end of the scapular blade is weakly expanded, and the posteroventral edge of the blade is weakly concave. The distal end of the scapula is broader and rounder in AMNH 5406 (Fig. 10A–D) when compared to AMNH 5424 ([6]: Fig. 3). The acromion occurs on the dorsal border of each scapula, laterally overhangs the main body of the scapula, and is most prominent over the glenoid. The infraspinous fossa is approximately triangular and ventral to the acromion. The acromion gradually decreases in size along the posterior edge of the infraspinous fossa. A prominent enthesis probably marks the insertion of the M. triceps longus caudalis (as in Ankylosaurus, see [39]: Fig. 15) in AMNH 5406 (Fig. 10A–D), TMP 2001.42.19 (Fig. 10E), and UALVP 31 (Fig. 10G). On the medial side, a prominent horizontal ridge, the scapulocoracoid buttress, occurs at the junction of the scapula and coracoid. The scapula and coracoid are unfused in AMNH 5406 (Fig. 10H) but fused in the larger specimens AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5424 ([6]: Fig. 3) and in the smaller specimen TMP 2001.42.9 (Fig. 10E,F); the sutural edge of the scapula in ROM 1930 is broken, possibly indicating that it was fused to the coracoid. The right coracoid of ROM 813 (Fig. 10I) has been heavily reconstructed with plaster so that it is unclear if fusion with the scapula had occurred. In lateral view, the scapula has a triangular ventral projection at the glenoid. The scapula and the coracoid contribute about equally to the glenoid, and the coracoid sutural surface in AMNH 5406 is flat (Fig. 10H). The coracoid is approximately square in lateral view, with a straight anterior margin and a prominent, hooked ventral (sternal) process. The coracoid foramen is circular. All humeri referred to Euoplocephalus tutus (Fig. 11, Table S7) are stout and hourglass-shaped. The deltopectoral crest extends for more than 42% the length of the humerus (Table S7). Penkalski [13] noted that the deltopectoral crest in MOR 433 does not appear to extend as far down the shaft of the humerus compared to other Euoplocephalus specimens. This is difficult to quantify because the proximal and distal ends of both humeri are badly damaged in MOR 433, making the total length of each humerus impossible to determine. In all specimens where this feature is preserved, distally the lateral margin of the deltopectoral crest is rotated slightly anteriorly, and merges with the shaft of the humerus as a prominent, thick knob (e.g. AMNH 5337, Fig. 11E). Prominent striations on the deltopectoral crest represent the attachments for the M. supracoracoideus and M. pectoralis [6]. Humeri referred to Euoplocephalus tutus differ in the relative sizes of the deltopectoral crests (both in terms of length and width) and the lateral supracondylar crests. These crests are largest in AMNH 5337 (Fig. 11D, E) and smallest in AMNH 5406 (Fig. 11A) and UALVP 31 (Fig. 11B). The humerus of AMNH 5337 is longer than the humeri of AMNH 5406 or UALVP 31, and so the larger crests of AMNH 5337 may be size-related. The humeral head in proximal view is semicircular (Fig. 11F), and subcircular to slightly triangular in medial view. Anteriorly the broad, shallow, bicipital fossa is bounded by the deltopectoral crest and humeral head. The medial (internal) tuberosity is prominent, and the proximal margin posterior to the humeral head is flat. The radial (lateral) condyle is slightly larger than the ulnar (medial) condyle, although both are large and transversely expanded. The olecranon fossa is shallow and triangular, and the intercondylar notch is shallow and rounded. The radial and ulnar condyles and the humeral heads in the humeri of AMNH 5337, AMNH 5404, and ROM 1930 have networks of deep furrows covering the articular surfaces similar to those of large individuals of hadrosaurids, iguanodontids, ceratopsids, sauropods, and some theropods (Fig. 11F, G).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g011Figure 11\nForelimb elements.\nAMNH 5406 right humerus in A) posterior view.

The radius is only known from a few specimens (Fig. 11L, M; Table S7). It is a stout bone with a flared, concave proximal articular surface, and a rugose, bluntly pointed distal end in anterior view (Fig. 11L, M). The proximal and distal ends of the radius of AMNH 5337 (Fig. 11L) are proportionately wider transversely than those of AMNH 5406 (Fig, 11M), ROM 784, and TMP 1997.132.1. In specimens where the ulnae are preserved, the proximal end has a prominent, rugose olecranon process (Fig. 11N, Table S7). A complete manus is not preserved in any specimen referred to Euoplocephalus tutus. Pelvic Girdle And Hindlimb The pelves of specimens referred to Euoplocephalus are mediolaterally broad, anteroposteriorly long, and have strongly divergent ilia (Fig. 10K, O, P; Table S8). Complete pelves are preserved in AMNH 5337, AMNH 5409 ([8]:Figs. 12, 13), and NHMUK R5161 ([21]:Pl VI, Fig.2, PL. VII, Fig. 1), and partial pelves are also known for AMNH 5245 (Fig. 10K), TMP 1982.9.3 (Fig. 10P) and UALVP 31 (Fig. 10O), as well as ROM 784 (Dyoplosaurus, [24]:Fig. 1). The postacetabular process of the ilium is proportionately longer in NHMUK R5161 compared to other referred specimens, and the process is longer than the maximum diameter of the acetabulum. The pubis is unknown. The ischium is wide proximally, and a sulcus on the lateral side contributes to the closed acetabulum (Fig. 10L, M). In medial view, the dorsal margin is rounded, and the iliac and pubic peduncles are not distinct from each other (Fig. 10N). The wide proximal end tapers abruptly into the ischial shaft. The ischial shaft is laterally compressed, and slightly sigmoidal in anterior and posterior views. The anterior and posterior margins are parallel for the length of the shaft, and the distal terminus is squared-off.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g012Figure 12\nHindlimb elements.\nTMP 1982.9.3 left femur in A) anterior, B) medial, and C) posterior views.

The femur (Figs. 12A–D, I–K, N, O) is stout and has a straight shaft with an oval cross-section. The femoral head is round, and the greater trochanter is neither prominent nor distinctly separated from the head. The fourth trochanter is a low and indistinct rugosity distal to the midlength of the femur. The distal condyles are posteriorly expanded, and the medial condyle is slightly larger than the lateral condyle. Posteriorly, the intercondylar groove is shallow. The lateral epicondyles are proportionately larger in AMNH 5266 (Fig. 12D) and TMP 1982.9.3 (Fig. 12C) than in AMNH 5404 (Fig. 12K).\nThe proximal and distal ends of the tibia (Figs. 12E–H, L, M, P) are greatly expanded relative to the shaft. In anterior view (Fig. 12H), the maximum dimension of the proximal end is slightly less than that of the distal end, whereas in lateral view (Fig. 12G), the proximal end is more than twice as wide as the distal end. In AMNH 5404 the astragalus is fused to the distal end of the tibia (Fig. 12L, M), but it is unfused in AMNH 5266 (Fig. 12E). Complete pedes are present in AMNH 5266 ([9]: Fig. 4) and ROM 1930; in each the pes is tridactyl, with U-shaped unguals (rather than triangular, as in ROM 784, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus; [24]: Fig. 5) in dorsal view. Osteoderms And Integument The cervical half rings of ankylosaurids (Fig. 13, Table S9) are composed of two separate layers of ossification: a superficial (upper) layer of primary osteoderms similar to those found on the rest of the body (sometimes ringed by smaller interstitial osteoderms), and a deep (lower) layer of bone of unknown origin, referred to here as the band. The band is formed of several dorsoventrally arched, approximately rectangular segments joined by serrated sutures; most cervical rings have six segments. Each band segment may have zero (Fig. 13V), one (Fig. 13B), or more than one (Fig. 13N) osteoderm superficial to the band; most commonly a single large osteoderm is present and centered on the segment. In some specimens (AMNH 5337, AMNH 5404; Fig. 13J–L), the overlying osteoderm is fused to the underlying band, but in others (UALVP 31; Fig. 13G, H) the osteoderm is only partially fused or not fused at all to the band. Band segments are always smooth-textured and are more similar in appearance to endochondral bone than to osteodermal bone, which is typically pitted or rugose in ankylosaurids. Weathered band segments can have a fibrous, interwoven texture. In most ankylosaurids (Ankylosaurus magniventris, Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus, and Saichania chulsanensis), the morphologies of the first and second cervical half rings are similar, with the second half ring being larger and broader than the first.\nPaired osteoderms on the cervical half ring share unique shapes, but the medial, lateral, and distal pairs differ from each other. In AMNH 5406, CMN 210 and UALVP 31 (Fig. 13A–H), the primary medial osteoderms have wide oval bases with anteroposteriorly-aligned keels, and the primary lateral osteoderms have narrower bases with sigmoidal keels [24]. The distal osteoderms (sensu [13]) are missing in UALVP 31 (Fig. 13G), but in CMN 210 (Fig. 13A) they are deeply excavated and compressed [24]. AMNH 5406, CMN 210, and UALVP 31 have the smallest known half rings referable to Euoplocephalus tutus. The half rings in AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, AMNH 5404, and AMNH 5405 all have lower, more rounded and rugose osteoderms on the first half ring (Fig. 13J–L). The distal osteoderms are missing in all of these specimens, but because the distal osteoderms do not seem to be as strongly fused in AMNH 5406 and CMN 210, they may not have been preserved.\nSeveral first cervical half rings referred to Euoplocephalus tutus, including CMN 8530, TMP 1982.9.3, TMP 1996.75.1, and TMP 1997.132.1, have small subcircular osteoderms present around the bases of the larger half ring osteoderms (Fig. 13M–O). These interstitial osteoderms are present even on small fragments of half rings (TMP 1982.9.3, TMP 1996.75.1; Fig. 13N). In CMN 8530 (Fig. 13M), only three of the interstitial osteoderms are preserved, but much of the dorsal surface of the half ring is broken. In TMP 1997.132.1 (Fig. 13O), the interstitial osteoderms ring the border of the preserved medial osteoderm, and are smaller and more irregularly distributed around the preserved lateral osteoderm. Unusually, AMNH 5404 has two knob-like projections on the ventral surface of the first cervical half ring, but these do not appear to be the same structures as the interstitial osteoderms found on other half rings.\nThe cervical rings in NHMUK R5161 (Fig. 13P) may have only four band segments rather than the six found in most other cervical rings referred to Euoplocephalus tutus. However, it is difficult to determine if the terminal edges of the half rings are broken or complete. No medial osteoderms are visible on the first cervical half ring, and if they are present, they are low and indistinct from the deep band. The lateral osteoderms have tall, laterally-directed keels and narrow bases, and are shaped like right-angle triangles in dorsal view. The second cervical ring also appears to have only four segments. The medial osteoderms are circular with posteriorly-directed apices. The lateral osteoderms are similar to those of the first cervical ring, but are somewhat more rectangular in dorsal view.\nA partial first cervical half ring was found with TMP 2001.42.19 (Fig. 13Q, R), and preserves the right medial, lateral, and distal osteoderms. (Osteoderms associated with TMP 2001.42.19 have been mounted onto a curved armature for display over the skeleton, which also includes two fragments of either the first and/or second cervical ring.) The medial osteoderm is nearly flat. Although the keel on the lateral osteoderm is broken, it appears to have been tall and straight rather than sigmoidal, and the distal tip of the osteoderm overhangs the underlying band. The distal osteoderm has a tall keel, and envelopes the distal end of the band. The flat medial osteoderm is unlike the keeled, subconical medial osteoderms of AMNH 5406, UALVP 31, and many other referred Euoplocephalus specimens, but similar to that of NHMUK R5161. The apices of the osteoderm keels are usually more centrally positioned in specimens referred to Euoplocephalus (AMNH 5406, UALVP 31), and never overhang the band. An isolated first cervical half ring, USNM 7943 (Fig. 13S, T) also preserves nearly flat medial osteoderms with low, centrally positioned prominences.\nOsteoderms along the body may also provide useful information, although few specimens preserve osteoderms in the original arrangements. Specimens that do retain in situ osteoderms include NHMUK R5161, ROM 813, ROM 1930, and TMP 1997.132.01. The in situ osteoderms of NHMUK R5161 were described in detail by Nopcsa [21] and Penkalski and Blows [34]. NHMUK R5161 has large, circular-based osteoderms covering most of the dorsal surface of the body, as well as paired, taller, conical osteoderms at the midline in the pectoral region.\nROM 813 is an exceptional specimen preserving abundant osteoderms, ossicles (<5 mm), and epidermal (soft-tissue) scale impressions [58]. Although it was referred to Euoplocephalus tutus by Penkalski [13], it preserves few diagnostic features of the Ankylosauridae, and none for the genus Euoplocephalus tutus. The straight shaft of the broken ischium, and the rugose, thin-walled osteoderms, suggest that ROM 813 is an ankylosaurid rather than a nodosaurid. The skeleton is disarticulated, but large portions of the integument remain intact. There are nine large blocks with in situ osteoderms. Two adjoining blocks contain a cluster of seven closely-packed large (length >25 cm) keeled osteoderms with rectangular bases. Each of these is surrounded by ossicles, and at the anterior edge of the cluster is a distinct crease similar to that found in NHMUK R5161. Another cluster of osteoderms surrounded by epidermal impressions and ossicles includes mostly osteoderms with subcircular bases, similar to those on the tail of NHMUK R5161. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine the original positions on the body of many of the integument pieces, because the endochondral elements are disarticulated.\nROM 1930 includes abundant osteoderms that have been completely prepared from the surrounding matrix, as well as in situ osteoderms on a block containing several caudal vertebrae. Three large (width >15 cm) keeled osteoderms with oval bases are preserved, as well as hundreds of small (<5 mm) irregularly-shaped ossicles.\nTwo additional specimens (TMP 1997.132.01 and UALVP 31) include some osteoderms that may be close to their in situ positions. TMP 1997.132.01 preserves large (>20 cm diameter) osteoderms near the humerus, articulated radius and ulna, and tibia, as well as a second cervical half ring band with in situ (but not coossified) osteoderms. Osteoderms near the humerus are large, keeled, and have subcircular bases (Fig. 11H). Osteoderms near the radius and ulna are smaller, with peaked keels overhanging one end of the base, and with narrower bases compared to osteoderms near the humerus. The cervical ring osteoderms also have oval bases and low keels, and the peaks of the keels do not overhang the bases of the osteoderms. The tail club (Fig. 14, Tables S6, S10) is one of the most recognizable features of derived ankylosaurids, but has been represented by only a few characters that essentially code for the presence or absence of the tail club. Tail club absent/present (character 173 in [32] and this paper) refers to the presence or absence of terminal osteoderms that envelop the end of the tail (knob osteoderms sensu [10]). Two additional characters define the handle vertebrae (sensu [10]): shape of distal caudal postzygapophyses (character 115) and extent of pre- and postzygapophyses over their adjacent centra in posterior vertebrae (character 116). However, morphological variation in the handle vertebrae and knob osteoderms may have taxonomic and phylogenetic significance. There is always a pair of large osteoderms (major osteoderms sensu [10]), and a variable number of smaller osteoderms that envelop the end of the tail (minor osteoderms sensu [10]). Variations in tail club knob morphology have been noted by Coombs [10], Arbour [59], and Arbour et al. [24]. AMNH 5216, AMNH 5245, and TMP 1994.168.1 are all wider than long, and have relatively pointed, triangular (in dorsal view) major knob osteoderms (Fig. 14A–D). UALVP 47273 is longer than wide and one of the smallest tail club knobs from Alberta; it is similar to the tail club of ROM 784, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus (Fig. 14N–P). The tail club knob of TMP 2001.42.19 (Fig. 14M) is also relatively small, but the length and width are nearly equal, unlike the condition in Dyoplosaurus. The major osteoderms of the knob are hemispherical in dorsal view. The distal part of the knob is somewhat damaged, making it difficult to determine how many minor osteoderms were present. The remaining tail clubs are usually equally as wide as long, or slightly longer than wide, and have major knob osteoderms that are semicircular in dorsal view. The number of minor osteoderms forming the terminus of the tail varies among specimens. Keels may be present at the mid-height of each major osteoderm (giving the knob a lenticular cross-section as in CMN 135 and ROM 7761), or near the dorsal surface of each osteoderm (giving the knob a semicircular cross-section as in AMNH 5245 and UALVP 16247).\nFigure 14\nTail clubs.\nTail club knobs from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in A–E: AMNH 5245 in A) dorsal and B) anterior views; C) TMP 1994.168.1 in dorsal view; D) AMNH 5216 in dorsal view; E) USNM 10753 in dorsal view.

Stratigraphic Distribution Of Ankylosaurid Specimens From Alberta And Montana Ankylosaurid remains have been recovered from several localities in southern Alberta, including the badlands along the Red Deer River from Tolman Bridge to Drumheller, and from the older strata within Dinosaur Provincial Park, to the east near Hilda, and to the south near Manyberries and Onefour (Fig. 1, Table S1, Locality Data S1). Ankylosaurids are represented primarily by isolated teeth in the Milk River [60],[61], Foremost, and Oldman formations, and by more complete material in the Dinosaur Park, Horseshoe Canyon, and Scollard formations [62].\nThe exact locality for the holotype of Euoplocephalus tutus (CMN 0210) is unknown. Field notes by L. Lambe (18 August 1897; CMN) state that it was collected from the east side of the Red Deer River near the mouth of Berry Creek, a region of Dinosaur Provincial Park that is today referred to as the Steveville area. The holotype of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus (ROM 784) was found within a region of Dinosaur Provincial Park known today as the core area, and the location of the quarry is figured in Arbour et al. ([24]: Fig. 2). Good locality data are known for CMN 8530, the holotype of Anodontosaurus lambei, which was collected from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation along the Red Deer River, southwest of the town of Morrin.\nThere is uncertainty regarding the location of the quarry for NHMUK R5161, the holotype of Scolosaurus cutleri. Nopcsa [21] gave the location for NHMUK R5161 as one half mile below Happy Jack ferry on the Red Deer River, about halfway up a 400-foot-deep canyon; this information was passed on to Nopcsa from F. A. Bather (NHMUK), who had received this information from W. Parks (ROM), who in turn had received this information from L. Sternberg. W. E. Cutler, who had originally discovered NHMUK R5161, was badly injured during its excavation [63], and so either one or several members of the Sternberg family finished the excavation. The quarry location was marked on the Steveville topographic map [44], but frequent attempts to find the quarry between 1967 and 2007 failed to find a quarry stake. When this locality was visited in 2007, the quarry stake was found downstream and down-section from where it had been marked on the map. Furthermore, it was posted at an angle at the top of a vertical wall, which makes it unlikely that this represents the quarry for NHMUK R5161 (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). GPS coordinates for this quarry stake provided by Currie and Russell [35] were taken from the map position. No photographs of the quarry are known in either museum collections or archives. However, a potential quarry has been located a short distance away from where the original quarry stake was found in 2007, and the skyline matches that in a poor photograph of the quarry that was published in a magazine (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). Unfortunately, no definitive evidence such as newspaper scraps with dates (used to identify ‘lost’ quarries [64]), or ankylosaurid elements, have been recovered, and there is some ambiguity regarding whether or not this quarry lies within the lowest Dinosaur Park Formation or the Oldman Formation (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). Additional fieldwork and research is required to verify the geographic and stratigraphic position of NHMUK R5161. The stratigraphic position for NHMUK R5161 reported in this paper is from Currie and Russell [35], but it should be noted that this specimen may instead have come from the Oldman Formation. In the Dinosaur Park Formation, nearly all ankylosaurid specimens that include more than a single isolated element (such as a tooth, isolated caudal vertebra, or osteoderm) have been recovered from within the lowest 30 meters of the formation (Fig. 15A). This is consistent with previous findings [65] that the proportion of ankylosaur teeth in microsite samples decreases in the upper part of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Exceptions to this are ROM 1930 (a skull with partial postcrania), and TMP 1997.132.01 (a skull with partial postcranium). TMP 1997.132.1 was not collected from Dinosaur Provincial Park, but from the area around Hilda, close to the Saskatchewan border. Within Dinosaur Provincial Park, numerous specimens are known from the western and central areas of the park, and fewer are known from the eastern end of the park and from the northern side of the Red Deer River (Locality Data S1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.g015Figure 15 Stratigraphic distribution of ankylosaurid specimens in the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon formations of Alberta. A) Distribution of ankylosaurid specimens within the Dinosaur Park Formation. Megaherbivore Assemblage Zones after Mallon et al. [18]. Specimens marked with green stars have GPS coordinates and accurate elevation data, specimens marked with yellow dots have elevations estimated from field notes, and the location of TMP 1991.127.1 (marked by a blue hexagon) was estimated from Alberta Township System coordinates. The elevation of some specimens with GPS coordinates was also estimated using field notes and Google Earth; the vertical lines associated with these illustrate the maximum elevation from using field note data only. Specimens marked by yellow dots, as such, could vary in elevation anywhere from three to seventeen meters. ROM 784 is the holotype of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and NHMUK R5161 is the holotype of Scolosaurus cutleri. Although the exact locality and elevation for the holotype of Euoplocephalus tutus (CMN 0210) is unknown, AMNH 5406 and UALVP 31 can be confidently referred to that taxon. B) Stratigraphic column showing Upper Cretaceous formations in southern Alberta. Nomenclature for the Horseshoe Canyon Formation follows Eberth and Braman [67]. CMN 8530, the holotype of Anodontosaurus lambei, occurs in the Horsethief Member. Two specimens, CMN 8876 and TMP 2000.57.30, were collected between Manyberries and Onefour, near the Alberta-Montana border (Fig. 1). The Dinosaur Park Formation thins in this region, and the Oldman Formation is well exposed. The exact locality is unknown for CMN 8876, so it is not clear if this specimen derives from the Oldman or Dinosaur Park Formation.\nSpecimens from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation were collected from exposures along the Red Deer River between Tolman Bridge and the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, from Rosebud Creek, and from west of the Red Deer River at the Three Hills Creek Locality (Fig. 1). CMN 8530 and TMP 1994.168.1 were collected between Morrin and the Bleriot Ferry (Fig. 1). In their review of Anchiceratops, Mallon et al. [66] noted that specimens collected in this region occur within a large sediment package that includes Coal Seams 8 and 9, in the upper part of Unit 1 of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, now defined as the Horsethief Member [67]. TMP 1982.9.3 was collected from Fox Coulee, between Coal Seams 7 and 8 (Eberth pers. comm.), placing this specimen within the Horsethief Member. AMNH 5266 and USNM 10753 were collected north of Morrin, and the original field notes do not include any distinctive lithostratigraphic or palaeontological features. However, these ankylosaur specimens occur south of Anchiceratops specimens that had good stratigraphic data constraining them to Unit 2 (Morrin Member sensu [67]) of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation [66], and north of Anchiceratops and ankylosaur specimens that are likely in the upper part of Unit 1 (Horsethief Member sensu [67]). AMNH 5266 and USNM 10753 were thus probably collected in the Horsethief or Morrin members of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. AMNH 5211, 5216, 5223, and 5245 were collected between 2.4 km (1.5 mi) upstream and 5.6 km (3.5 mi) downstream of the Tolman Bridge (previously the Tolman Ferry). Unfortunately, the exact localities for these specimens are unknown, but the Morrin, Tolman and Carbon members (sensu [67]) of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation crop out in this region of the Red Deer River [66]. Two specimens were collected from localities other than those along the Red Deer River. TMP 1996.75.1 was collected from Three Hills Creek, from the Horsethief Member (Eberth pers. comm.), and TMP 1997.59.1 was collected from Rosebud Creek, from the Morrin Member (Eberth pers. comm.).\nOnly one species, Ankylosaurus magniventris, is found in the Scollard Formation in Alberta and no other ankylosaurids appear to have been contemporaneous with this taxon. At present, no definitive ankylosaurid fossils have been recovered from Judithian sediments in Alberta anywhere north of Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park, including the fossiliferous localities in the city of Edmonton, or around Grande Prairie in northwestern Alberta.\nTrexler [68] noted the presence of cf. Euoplocephalus at two localities (Landslide Butte and Two Medicine River) in the Two Medicine Formation and fragmentary ankylosaurid remains from the Choteau/Bynum locality. At all three localities, ankylosaurids were only recovered from the upper part of the Two Medicine Formation. MOR 433 was collected from approximately 55 m below the contact with the Bearpaw Shale [25]. Taxonomic Implications Of Variation In Specimens Previously Referred To Euoplocephalus Tutus Status Of Anodontosaurus Lambei\nVariation within a population can result from ontogenetic differences, individual differences (both heritable and acquired), sexual dimorphism, and pathologies (and, additionally for fossil organisms, from taphonomic changes). If Euoplocephalus tutus is monotypic, there should be no clusters of shared, distinctive morphological features, (unless there is sexual dimorphism) and there should be no stratigraphic separation of groupings of morphological features. A review of morphological variation in specimens previously referred to Euoplocephalus tutus shows that certain features previously considered to result from individual variation are associated with each other, and are stratigraphically separated (Table 2). These features include the presence or absence of small circular caputegulae at the base of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns (postocular caputegulae, Fig. 5), the presence or absence of similar small circular osteoderms (interstitial osteoderms) around the primary osteoderms of the first cervical half ring (Fig. 13), the width:length ratio of the tail club knob, and the shape (semicircular vs. triangular) of the tail club knob osteoderms in dorsal view (Fig. 14).\nTable 2 Presence or absence of diagnostic features in Anodontosaurus, Dyoplosaurus, Euoplocephalus, and Scolosaurus.

Horseshoe Canyon Formation members sensu Eberth and Braman [67].doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062421.t002\nSpecimens previously referred to Euoplocephalus tutus that lack postocular caputegulae never have interstitial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring (Table 2). Specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus that have postocular caputegulae may or may not have interstitial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring. This is a subtle difference and could be attributed to intraspecific variation; however, the presence or absence of small caputegulae near the squamosal and quadratojugal horns and on the cervical half rings correlates with the stratigraphic position of the specimen. All specimens from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation have small caputegulae at the bases of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns and interstitial osteoderms on the cervical half rings (these are visible even on highly fragmentary cervical half rings such as the one preserved with TMP 1982.9.3). Only two specimens from the Dinosaur Park Formation have these small caputegulae: AMNH 5238, from Dinosaur Provincial Park, and TMP 1997.132.1, from the area around Hilda, Alberta (near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border). TMP 1997.132.1 is from the upper 30 m of the Dinosaur Park Formation, but the stratigraphic position of AMNH 5238 is unknown. No specimens from the lower 30 m of the Dinosaur Park Formation have small caputegulae at the bases of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns or secondary osteoderms on the cervical half rings. The stratigraphic separation of the presence or absence of these caputegulae and osteoderms suggests that specimens from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation are not the same species as those from the lower part of the Dinosaur Park Formation. TMP 2001.49.2, from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, has postocular osteoderms on the skull, but does not have interstitial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring; an isolated half ring (USNM 7943) from the Two Medicine Formation also lacks interstitial osteoderms. The size and shape of the tail club knob (Fig. 14, Table S10) varies significantly among specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus, as reviewed by Coombs [10]. However, tail club knobs that are wider than long (AMNH 5216, AMNH 5245; Figs. 14A, D) also tend to have major knob osteoderms that are triangular (“bluntly pointed” sensu [10]) in dorsal view. Tail club knobs that are longer than wide (UALVP 47273; Fig. 14P) or approximately as wide as long (TMP 1983.36.120, TMP 2001.49.2; Figs. 14J, M) have major knob osteoderms that are semicircular in dorsal view. Again, these differences are stratigraphically separated, with wide, pointed tail club knobs found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and round or elongate, semicircular tail club knobs found in the Dinosaur Park and Two Medicine formations. Differences in proportions are not entirely related to absolute size, as both ROM 788 (from the Dinosaur Park Formation) and AMNH 5245 (from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation) are almost the same width, but AMNH 5245 is not as long as ROM 788 (Table S10). Unfortunately, no tail club knobs from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation are associated with cranial material. Only a few tail club knobs from the Dinosaur Park Formation have associated cranial material: AMNH 5403, AMNH 5405, and the holotype of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, ROM 784.\nThe morphology of osteoderms, and their distribution on the body, is known to vary in several extant animals. The number of moveable thoracic carapace segments in several species of armadillos can vary by one to three bands; in the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), variation in number of segments is associated with geographic occurrence [69]. The number of osteoderms in the cervical region of crocodilians differs between species, but also varies among individuals of each species [70]. Ornamentation on the osteoderms of the broad-headed skink Eumeces laticeps increases with an increase in body size [71]. Given the documented variation in extant taxa, caution should be used when identifying potential taxonomically useful features in the osteoderms and cranial ornamentation of ankylosaurs. Some caputegulae positions and shapes are consistent in all known skulls previously referred to Euoplocephalus: all skulls have rugose, arched supranarial caputegulae, all have a roughly hexagonal median nasal plate that is larger than all of the other frontonasal caputegulae, and all have rectangular lacrimal and loreal caputegulae. Variation in cranial ornamentation also exists within specimens previously referred to Euoplocephalus, most notably in the number, shapes, and sizes of the caputegulae of the frontals, parietals, and nasals. However, discontinuous, stratigraphically-separated variation in the presence or absence of postocular caputegulae, the presence or absence of interstitial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring, and tail club knob osteoderm shape, is more likely the result of taxonomic variation rather than intraspecific or ontogenetic variation in Euoplocephalus.\nThe stratigraphic separation of unique sets of morphological features in specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus indicates that more than one species is currently represented by material referred to Euoplocephalus tutus. Although the exact type locality for Euoplocephalus tutus (CMN 210) is unknown, the localities for AMNH 5406 and UALVP 31 (which can be confidently referred to Euoplocephalus tutus based on cervical half ring morphology) are known, and both are from the lower Dinosaur Park Formation. The skull of UALVP 31 does not have postocular caputegulae (Fig. 5), and the cervical half rings of AMNH 5406, CMN 0210, and UALVP 31 do not have interstitial osteoderms (Fig. 13). As such, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation morphotype, which has these caputegulae and osteoderms, should not be referred to Euoplocephalus tutus. The holotype of Anodontosaurus lambei (CMN 8530) was collected from section 3, township 21, range 31, W 4th Meridian, placing this specimen within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. CMN 8530 has postocular caputegulae at the base of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns (Fig. 5) and interstitial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring (Fig. 13). The presence of these caputegulae and osteoderms on the skull and cervical half ring suggest that Anodontosaurus lambei is distinct from Euoplocephalus tutus, and specimens from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation should be referred to Anodontosaurus lambei rather than Euoplocephalus tutus. It could be argued that these differences are insufficient for resurrecting the genus Anodontosaurus, and instead the Horseshoe Canyon Formation specimens should be referred to as a second species of Euoplocephalus, E. lambei. Given that the phylogenetic resolution of derived ankylosaurids is poor at present ([32],[72], this paper), it is here considered best to simply resurrect Anodontosaurus lambei rather than create additional taxonomic confusion by creating a new combination.\nAlthough no tail club knobs are associated with diagnostic cranial material, the consistent morphology of tail club knobs from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation suggests that a single taxon is represented, and so it is best to refer them to Anodontosaurus lambei as well. As such, Anodontosaurus lambei also differs from Euoplocephalus tutus in the morphology of the tail club knob. In Anodontosaurus lambei, the tail club knob is wider than long, and the major knob osteoderms are bluntly pointed and triangular in dorsal view (Fig. 14).\nAnother potential difference between Anodontosaurus lambei and specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus is the shape of the free caudal vertebrae. CMN 8530 includes a free caudal vertebra that differs from ankylosaurid free caudal vertebrae from the Dinosaur Park Formation, as the centrum has octagonal anterior and posterior faces, rather than circular (Fig. 9K). The only other specimen from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation that preserves free caudal vertebrae is AMNH 5245, and in this specimen the vertebrae are pathological and their original shapes are obscured. It is therefore not possible to determine if the centrum shape in CMN 8530 represents a taxonomic difference or individual variation, although it should be noted that centrum shape does not appear to vary among specimens from the Dinosaur Park Formation.\nAlthough the sample size is small, femoral morphology appears to differ between specimens from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and Dinosaur Park Formation (Fig. 12). In the femora of AMNH 5266 and TMP 1982.9.3 from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Figs. 12C, D), the lateral epicondyles are more prominent than that of AMNH 5404, from the Dinosaur Park Formation (Fig. 12K). This does not appear to be size-related, as the lateral epicondyle is proportionately larger in AMNH 5266 even though this femur is less than half the length of AMNH 5404.\nWithin the Dinosaur Park Formation, most specimens that include more than just teeth or isolated osteoderms have been collected from the lowest 30 m of the formation. Two notable exceptions to this are ROM 1930 and TMP 1997.132.1, which were collected from the upper 30 m of the formation. TMP 1997.132.1 has postocular caputegulae, but ROM 1930 does not (Fig. 5), and, TMP 1997.132.1 has interstitial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring (Fig. 13O). Based on the presence of these osteoderms, TMP 1997.132.1 is referred to Anodontosaurus lambei, which extends the stratigraphic range of this species into the upper Dinosaur Park Formation. This makes TMP 1997.132.01 by far the most complete specimen of Anodontosaurus lambei, as this specimen includes a complete skull, right mandible, three dorsal vertebrae, ribs, scapula, left humerus, ulna, radius, and tibia.\nAMNH 5266, a partial juvenile skeleton, was referred to Euoplocephalus tutus by Coombs [9]; because Coombs had previously synonymized Anodontosaurus lambei with Euoplocephalus tutus, his comparison focused on differences between Ankylosaurus magniventris and Euoplocephalus tutus only. This specimen derives from either the Morrin or Tolman member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and thus is most likely referable to Anodontosaurus lambei. AMNH 5266 lacks a skull, first cervical half ring, and tail club, and so it preserves no diagnostic features of Anodontosaurus lambei. However, the femur has a prominent lateral epicondyle, similar to that of TMP 1982.9.3 but different from that of AMNH 5404 (Fig. 12). Because this feature is subtle and the sample size is limited, the relative prominence of the lateral epicondyle is not here considered a diagnostic feature. However, the similarity of the femora of AMNH 5266 and TMP 1982.9.3 suggests that AMNH 5266 can be referred to Anodontosaurus. Status Of Scolosaurus Cutleri\nWith the recognition of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus [24], and now Anodontosaurus lambei as species distinct from Euoplocephalus tutus, only Scolosaurus cutleri remains from the list of taxa synonymized by Coombs [7]. Penkalski and Blows [34] have argued for the separation of Scolosaurus from Dyoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus based on several morphological features. The holotype of Scolosaurus cutleri (NHMUK R5161) is one of the most complete ankylosaurs ever collected, preserving nearly the entire skeleton as well as in situ osteoderms and skin impressions. However, it is challenging to compare this specimen with other specimens for several reasons. First, it lacks a skull and tail club, which contain important taxonomic information. Second, although the in situ osteoderms and skin impressions provide important information on the integument of ankylosaurs, they also obscure certain skeletal elements such as the scapula and pelvis. Third, the specimen is currently on display tipped onto its right side, in a relatively dark area, in a glass cabinet that cannot be easily opened, which makes detailed examination of the specimen difficult, especially the anterior and left side of the animal. Nevertheless, it is possible to assess the taxonomic status of NHMUK R5161 as it preserves the first cervical half ring, and thus can be compared to both Anodontosaurus lambei and Euoplocephalus tutus.\nThe first cervical half ring of NHMUK R5161 (Fig. 13P) lacks interstitial osteoderms ringing the larger primary osteoderms, which indicates that NHMUK R5161 is not referable to Anodontosaurus lambei. Although these may appear to be present on the second cervical half ring, these are epidermal scales and not osteoderms (see [34]). NHMUK R5161 differs subtly from Euoplocephalus tutus (AMNH 5406, CMN 0210, and UALVP 31) in the shape of the first cervical ring osteoderms, as it has low medial osteoderms, each of which lacks a distinct keel but has a low, somewhat posteriorly placed prominence (Fig. 13P). The lateral osteoderms appear to have a prominent, laterally-directed keel. In contrast, AMNH 5406, CMN 0210, and UALVP 31 have tall medial osteoderms with prominent keels (Fig. 13A, B, F, G). Some referred Euoplocephalus tutus first cervical half rings (AMNH 5337, AMNH 5404) also have low medial osteoderms (Fig. 13J–L), but in these specimens the medial osteoderms still have a keel, and the lateral osteoderms are also low, which differs from the condition in NHMUK R5161 where the lateral osteoderms are tall.\nPenkalski and Blows [34] also note differences in shape between the medial osteoderms of NHMUK R5161 and other referred Euoplocephalus specimens. They point out that the anteroposterior length of the cervical half ring band was larger in NHMUK R5161 than in Euoplocephalus specimens AMNH 5406 and UALVP 31. However, the humerus of NHMUK R5161 is also larger than those of AMNH 5406 and UALVP 31 (Table S7), and so the greater anteroposterior band length in NHMUK R5161 may simply be a result of NHMUK R5161 being a larger individual than either AMNH 5406 or UALVP 31.\nThe first cervical half ring in NHMUK R5161 is not as well preserved as that of the second half ring, which at first seems to differ greatly from second cervical half rings referred to Euoplocephalus tutus (AMNH 5403, TMP 2007.12.52). No other second cervical half rings referred to Euoplocephalus tutus preserve the superficial primary osteoderms (Fig. 13U, V), but these are present on NHMUK R5161 (Fig. 13P). However, it appears that the cervical half ring osteoderms do not always fuse to the band; matrix separates the osteoderms from the band in the first cervical half ring of UALVP 31 (Fig. 13G). As such, the presence or absence of osteoderms on the second cervical half ring is not taxonomically informative. The morphology of the osteoderms on the second cervical half ring in NHMUK R5161 can, however, be used to corroborate the morphology of the more poorly preserved first cervical half ring. In the ankylosaurids Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus [33], Saichania chulsanensis (MPC 100/151), and Shamosaurus scutatus Tumanova, 1983 [73] (PIN 3779/2), the first and second cervical half rings are nearly identical except in terms of overall size. In the second cervical half ring of NHMUK R5161, the medial osteoderms are nearly flat with low posterior prominences and circular bases, and the lateral osteoderms are tall and sharply keeled, a morphology unknown in any other referred Euoplocephalus tutus half ring from Alberta. The morphology of the cervical half rings in NHMUK R5161 supports the Penkalski and Blows [34] interpretation of Scolosaurus cutleri as a species distinct from Euoplocephalus tutus, and also separates it from Anodontosaurus lambei. As discussed for Anodontosaurus lambei, it is preferred to maintain separation at the generic level rather than creating the new combination E. cutleri.\nScolosaurus cutleri can also be differentiated from Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus by the orientation of the anterior sacral ribs, which are anteroventrally directed in Dyoplosaurus but laterally directed in Scolosaurus. NHMUK R5161 also has a proportionally longer postacetabular process of the ilium. Scolosaurus cutleri may also have incorporated more caudals into the sacrum (but not necessarily sacral rod – caudosacrals may not fuse at the centra, but their transverse processes fuse to the ilium) compared to Anodontosaurus lambei, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, and specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus. NHMUK R5161 has three caudosacrals, whereas Dyoplosaurus ROM 784 preserves two, and AMNH5337 and AMNH5409 each preserve one (the sacra for AMNH 5245 and TMP 1982.9.3 are incomplete). However, it is unclear if the number of caudosacrals is associated with absolute size or ontogeny. The pelves of AMNH 5409 and NHMUK R5161 are nearly the same length (length of ilium in NHMUK R5161 = 96 cm, from [21]; length along midline of pelvis in AMNH 5409 = 92 cm). ROM 1930 may have had three caudosacrals, but these are not preserved in association with a complete pelvis, so it is not possible to determine for certain if these vertebrae were fused to the ilia. It is possible that fewer sacral vertebrae are present in specimens other than NHMUK R5161 because of post-depositional damage, although this seems unlikely for ROM 784 (Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus), which has a complete, articulated caudal series. At present, the number of dorsosacral, sacral, and caudosacral vertebrae cannot be used to support taxonomic distinctions among Albertan and Montanan ankylosaurids.\nPenkalski and Blows [34] observed differences in the humeri and radii of AMNH 5406 and NHMUK R5161: AMNH 5406 is smaller, the deltopectoral crest does not extend as far down the shaft as that in NHMUK R5161, and the radial condyle extends farther distally than in other specimens (although these other specimens are not specified in [34]). The deltopectoral crest of AMNH 5406 (Fig. 11A) does not extend as far down the shaft as in AMNH 5337, a larger specimen, but seems to extend proportionately as far in ROM 47655 (Fig. 11K), the largest humerus encountered in this study. The radial condyle does extend somewhat further distally compared to AMNH 5404 (Fig. 11I), but is again similar to ROM 47655. It should be stressed that variations in the extent of the deltopectoral crest and radial condyle are both subtle, and size should not be used as a diagnostic character in the absence of ontogenetic data. For this reason, there is no reason to consider the morphology of the humerus in NHMUK R5161 significantly different than that of other referred Euoplocephalus specimens. As such, humeral morphology is not diagnostic for Scolosaurus. Penkalski and Blows [34] considered the radius of NHMUK R5161 to be more sigmoidal than those of any other referred Euoplocephalus specimens, or than that in Dyoplosaurus. The radius as figured by Nopcsa ([21]: plate VI) does have a weakly sigmoidal appearance that differs from the radii of AMNH 5337 (Fig. 11L) and AMNH 5406 (Fig. 11M), and so this may be a diagnostic character of NHMUK R5161.\nNHMUK R5161 differs from ROM 784 (Dyoplosaurus) in the morphology of the pedal unguals, which are U-shaped in ventral view in NHMUK R5161 and triangular in ROM 784. Scolosaurus may also differ from Dyoplosaurus in the morphology and pattern of post-cervical osteoderms [34]. ROM 784 has triangular osteoderms on the lateral sides of the posterior region of the pelvis and anterior part of the tail, which are not present in NHMUK R5161. Although the integument is fairly complete dorsally in NHMUK R5161, osteoderms are not preserved lateral to the caudal vertebrae, and so it is possible that compressed, triangular osteoderms were present in NHMUK R5161 but not preserved. Status Of Oohkotokia Horneri\nPenkalski [25] identified several diagnostic features that separated ankylosaurids from the Two Medicine Formation from Dyoplosaurus, Euoplocephalus (including Anodontosaurus), and Scolosaurus: a proportionately small median nasal caputegulum not distinguished from surrounding caputegulae; keeled, trihedral squamosal horns with posteriorly-situated apices; quadratojugal horns with strong posterior curvature; nuchal crest not visible in lateral view; small occipital condyle; large orbit; basally excavated osteoderms with weakly ornamented surface texture; and steeply-pitched triangular caudal osteoderms.\nPenkalski [25] emphasized the small median nasal caputegulum of specimens from the Two Medicine Formation as an important difference between Oohkotokia and Euoplocephalus. In all specimens referred to Oohkotokia, the anterior portion of the rostrum is broken, and so the median nasal caputegulum is either absent or only partially preserved. Although FPDM V-31, NSM PV 20381, and TMP 2001.42.19 appear to have complete skulls, the anterior portion of the rostrum in each of these specimens is reconstructed. The morphology of the median nasal plate does not provide strong evidence for the separation of the Two Medicine Formation specimens from Euoplocephalus. However, the distinctive morphology of the squamosal horns of the Two Medicine Formation ankylosaurids noted by Penkalski [25] differentiates the Two Medicine ankylosaurid from Euoplocephalus, and from Anodontosaurus. Skulls from the Two Medicine Formation share one feature that is not present in any other specimen referred to Euoplocephalus –a long, pointed, back-swept squamosal horn (Fig. 5M–P). As such, all of the skulls from this formation likely represent a single taxon. Although the squamosal horns of AMNH 5405, TMP 1991.127.1, and UALVP 31 are pointed (Fig. 5A–C), they are never as long as those in specimens from the Two Medicine Formation. No specimens from Alberta have the characteristic back-swept appearance in lateral view that is present in specimens from Montana. The Two Medicine ankylosaurid can be differentiated from Dyoplosaurus based on the morphology of the pedal unguals (U-shaped in dorsal view in TMP 2001.42.9, triangular in ROM 784).\nPenkalski [25] noted two main differences between MOR 433 and NHMUK R5161 (Scolosaurus). First, the transverse processes were proportionately longer relative to centrum width in MOR 433 compared to NHMUK R5161. Furthermore, NHMUK R5161 does not preserve any low-keeled oval osteoderms or steeply pitched triangular osteoderms, two morphologies that were found associated with the holotype skull of MOR 433 (see [25]: Fig. 4D and F). In MPC 100/1305, a Mongolian ankylosaurid that preserves numerous in situ osteoderms, low-keeled oval osteoderms with off-centre keels are found only on the lateral sides of the trunk, and steeply pitched triangular osteoderms are found only on the lateral sides of the pelvis and tail. Low-keeled osteoderms are found on the dorsal side of the trunk and tail (see [74]). Although NHMUK R5161 preserves most of the dorsal integument, it does not preserve osteoderms on the flanks or lateral sides of the tail, and so it is conceivable that the absence of the unique MOR 433 osteoderm morphologies in NHMUK R5161 is a preservational artifact. The length of the transverse processes relative to the width of the centrum varies along the caudal vertebral column in ankylosaurids, with transverse processes decreasing in size posteriorly. In order to demonstrate that the relatively longer transverse process in MOR 433 is a taxonomic difference and not a positional difference, the position of this caudal vertebra would need to be known so it could be compared to the equivalent position in NHMUK R5161.\nNeither osteoderm morphology nor vertebral proportions provide compelling evidence to separate Oohkotokia from Scolosaurus. However, Oohkotokia and Scolosaurus share a cervical half ring morphology that differs markedly from those of Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. TMP 2001.42.19, from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, includes a partial first cervical half ring (Fig. 13Q, R) that is similar to the cervical half rings of NHMUK R5161 (Fig. 13P), and an isolated half ring from the Two Medicine Formation, USNM 7943 (Fig. 13S, T), shares this morphology. In both of the Two Medicine specimens and Scolosaurus, the medial osteoderms are nearly flat and each has a low central prominence and a circular base. In contrast, the first cervical half rings of AMNH 5406, CMN 0210, UALVP 31, and all other referred Euoplocephalus half rings have medial osteoderms with longitudinal keels, even those in which the medial osteoderms are relatively low (e.g. AMNH 5404). (Gilmore [75] also remarked on the differences in osteoderm morphology between USNM 7943 and the holotype of E. tutus, CMN 0210.) The first cervical half ring of Anodontosaurus has small interstitial osteoderms that are not present in any Two Medicine specimens. There are no features that differ significantly between the Two Medicine Formation specimens and Scolosaurus, and for this reason the Two Medicine ankylosaur is best referred to Scolosaurus. TMP 2001.42.19 includes both a skull and tail club, which are both absent in the holotype of Scolosaurus.\nTMP 2001.42.19 provides insight into the growth of the tail club knob and variation of ankylosaurid knobs. The maximum width across the supraorbitals in TMP 2001.42.19 is 26 cm, and the maximum width of the knob is 31 cm. In contrast, the preserved portion of the skull of ROM 784 (Dyoplosaurus) has a maximum width across the supraorbitals of 33 cm, and the tail club knob maximum width is 16.6 cm. TMP 2001.42.1 is a smaller individual than ROM 784 yet has a larger tail club knob (Fig. 14M, O); the ratio of knob width to length also differs between the two specimens (1.07 in TMP 2001.42.1 vs. 0.68 in ROM 784). This suggests that the small knob and low width:length ratio of Dyoplosaurus may not be entirely due to ontogeny, as a larger knob is known in a smaller individual of Scolosaurus. An alternate explanation is that the timing of knob osteoderm growth occurred later in Dyoplosaurus relative to Scolosaurus. However, even if the knobs of both taxa eventually grew to equivalent sizes, the difference in the timing of growth is an interesting taxonomic difference. Status Of Other Specimens Previously Referred To Euoplocephalus Tutus Although numerous well-preserved skulls have been referred to Euoplocephalus tutus, none of the holotypes of the Dinosaur Park Formation ankylosaurids (Euoplocephalus tutus, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, and Scolosaurus cutleri) include good cranial material. This makes the referral of skulls to any given species difficult, and means that postcranial elements must be used to identify specimens to species level. However, non-overlapping postcranial material among the holotype specimens also makes this challenging. Each of the holotypes of Anodontosaurus lambei, Euoplocephalus tutus and Scolosaurus cutleri includes a first cervical half ring, but none is preserved in Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus. Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and Scolosaurus cutleri both include pelvic and anterior caudal regions, but Scolosaurus cutleri does not preserve the tail club; the holotype of Euoplocephalus tutus preserves no postcrania other than the first cervical half ring. AMNH 5406 and UALVP 31 can be referred to Euoplocephalus tutus based on cervical half ring morphology, and UALVP 31 includes a good skull. The skull of TMP 1991.127.1 is nearly identical to that of UALVP 31 and so can also be confidently referred to Euoplocephalus; each skull even has a distinct shallow furrow on the posterior supraorbital (Fig. 3; Figs. S2, S7).\nThe morphology of the pelvis can be used to differentiate Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and Scolosaurus cutleri, and potentially Euoplocephalus tutus as well. The pelves of AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 differ from the pelvis of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus in the orientation of the sacral transverse processes, which are anteroventrally directed in Dyoplosaurus but laterally directed in AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409. AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 differ from NHMUK R5161 (Scolosaurus) in the relative length of the postacetabular process of the ilium. AMNH 5337 includes a skull that is generally similar to that of UALVP 31, but does have some notable differences. In particular, the squamosal horns of AMNH 5337 are much shorter and more rounded, and the cranial caputegulae are less distinct, compared to those of UALVP 31 (Figs. 3, 4). Coombs [4] noted that smaller skulls had more prominent and pointed squamosal and quadratojugal horns compared to larger skulls. Penkalski [13], in a morphometric analysis of referred Euoplocephalus tutus skulls, found that squamosal horn height decreased with increasing skull size. He also reported a positive correlation between skull size and rugosity of osteoderm sculpturing. If squamosal horn length and bluntness, and cranial caputegulum distinctness, are related to size, then they are probably a result of ontogenetic changes. Horner and Goodwin [76], in a discussion of ontogeny in the pachycephalosaurids Dracorex, Stygimoloch, and Pachycephalosaurus, suggested that the pyramidal nodes on the nasals and the squamosal horns of these taxa decreased in size and became more rounded through ontogeny. Scannella and Horner [77] also suggested that the epoccipitals of Triceratops become lower, and less distinct from the frill throughout ontogeny. It is possible that cranial ornamentation in Euoplocephalus tutus followed a similar trajectory as that observed for Pachycephalosaurus and Triceratops, with the squamosal horns being resorbed and the cranial sculpturing becoming less distinct. UALVP 31 appears to have resorption pits on the squamosal horns, which would support this hypothesis (Fig. 3B). Penkalski and Blows [34] state that none of the referred Euoplocephalus specimens, except for AMNH 5266 (herein considered Anodontosaurus) represented young juveniles. The ontogenetic stage of a dinosaur is best assessed using histological sections, and no studies have been published on histological sections of ankylosaur long bones for the purpose of determining ontogenetic stage. As such, it is not currently possible to confidently determine the relative ontogenetic stages of ankylosaurs, let alone specimens previously referred to Euoplocephalus. Histological sampling and analysis is required in order to test the hypothesis that changes in cranial ornamentation in Euoplocephalus are related to ontogeny.\nMany of the diagnostic features of Euoplocephalus tutus proposed by Coombs [4] and Vickaryous and Russell [16] have broader distributions among Anodontosaurus, Dyoplosaurus, and Scolosaurus. Ciliary osteoderms are also preserved in the holotype of Dyoplosaurus (Fig. 6G) and a shallow nasal vestibule, intranarial septum formed by a vertical process of the premaxilla, and medially convergent but anteriorly and posteriorly divergent maxillary tooth rows occur in Anodontosaurus and Scolosaurus. Premaxillae that are not covered by expanded nasals and that are equal or wider than the width between the most posterior maxillary teeth, slit-like nostrils, and a palate that does not taper anteriorly occur in both Anodontosaurus and Scolosaurus as well. If the differences between the skulls of AMNH 5337 and UALVP 31 are not taxonomically significant, and because the pelvis of AMNH 5337 differs from those of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and Scolosaurus cutleri (but is consistent with what is preserved in UALVP 31), then AMNH 5337 is probably referable to Euoplocephalus tutus. In turn, the cervical half ring morphology of AMNH 5337 is similar to those of AMNH 5403, AMNH 5404, and AMNH 5405, all of which include skulls. Postcranially, AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5404 are large, robust individuals, whereas AMNH 5406, CMN 210, and UALVP 31 are relatively small, gracile individuals. Compared to other specimens, AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5404 have relatively larger deltopectoral and lateral supracondylar crests of the humeri and have muscle scars that are more prominent (Fig. 11D, E, I, J). The first cervical half rings of AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, AMNH 5404, and AMNH 5405 are anteroposteriorly longer than those of AMNH 5406, CMN 0210, and UALVP 31 (Fig. 13, Table S9). Penkalski [13] suggested that the cervical half ring of AMNH 5406 was similar in size to other referred Euoplocephalus tutus specimens, which is true in terms of the mediolateral width, but not in terms of anteroposterior length.\nLarger first cervical half rings are also found in specimens with lower, more rugose, and less distinct primary osteoderms (AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, AMNH 5404; Fig. 13J–L) compared to specimens with anteroposteriorly shorter cervical half rings (AMNH 5406, CMN 210, UALVP 31; Fig. 13A–H). As in the skulls, perhaps the cervical half ring osteoderms fused with the band but were resorbed during ontogeny. UALVP 31 has resorption pits on the apices of the medial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring (Fig. 13H). Larger cervical half rings with more rugose primary osteoderms that are completely fused to the cervical rings may belong to ontogenetically older individuals. Alternately, more robust individuals referred to Euoplocephalus tutus represent a distinct species; however, this seems unlikely given the continuum of morphologies observed in the referred specimens.\nAMNH 5403 and AMNH 5405 include tail clubs with the round, semicircular morphology (e.g. Fig. 14H, J–L) that is distinct from the tail club knobs of Anodontosaurus lambei (AMNH 5245; Fig. 14A), and Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus (ROM 784, UALVP 47273; Fig. 14O, P); Anodontosaurus knobs are wider than long and have triangular major osteoderms, and Dyoplosaurus knobs are longer than wide. The tail club of TMP 2001.42.9 (Fig. 14M), here referred to Scolosaurus cutleri, has a similar round shape to those of AMNH 5403 and AMNH 5405. Because Euoplocephalus and Scolosaurus appear to overlap stratigraphically, and because their tail club morphology is similar, isolated round tail club knobs from the Dinosaur Park Formation can no longer be referred to Euoplocephalus tutus.\nPenkalski [13] suggested that ROM 1930 may be referable to Scolosaurus cutleri, although he did not formally resurrect that species. In particular, he indicated that radially ribbed, perforate, conical osteoderms only occur in ROM 1930 and NHMUK R5161 ([13]∶270). Later in the same paper, he stated that AMNH 5337 has perforate osteoderms ([13]: 287) and that most referred Euoplocephalus tutus osteoderms have some degree of ribbing or fluting ([13]∶289). Penkalski and Blows [34] suggest that ROM 1930 might be referable to Scolosaurus (although do not list it as a referred specimen), citing the lack of low-keeled osteoderms found in other Euoplocephalus specimens like AMNH 5406, and the presence of conical osteoderms similar to those in NHMUK R5161. ROM 1930 includes a skull (Figs. 3, 4, 5), three dorsal vertebrae, partial sacrum (Fig. 9A, B), caudal vertebrae (Fig. 9M), fragmentary right scapula, right humerus (Fig. 11C), and osteoderms (including in situ osteoderms on two blocks of articulated free caudal vertebrae). Field notes by G. F. Sternberg (1914; CMN) indicate that cervical half rings may also have been collected, but these are not yet prepared. The skull lacks postocular osteoderms and the squamosal horns do not have the long, backswept morphology of those from the Two Medicine Formation. If the referral of the Two Medicine ankylosaurid material to Scolosaurus is correct, then ROM 1930 is not referable to Scolosaurus.\nROM 813 is a remarkable but problematic specimen that preserves keratinous scale impressions as well as the underlying (deep) ossicles and osteoderms [58]. This specimen was referred to Euoplocephalus tutus by Penkalski [13]. However, there are few features that allow it to be confidently assigned to Ankylosauridae, let alone to a particular genus or species. The straight shaft of the broken ischium, and the rugose, thin-walled osteoderms suggest that ROM 813 is an ankylosaurid rather than a nodosaurid. ROM 813 has rectangular, keeled osteoderms, unlike those present in NHMUK R5161; and because NHMUK R5161 preserves nearly the entire dorsal integument it is unlikely that ROM 813 is referable to Scolosaurus cutleri. ROM 813 is from the lowest levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation and as such is unlikely to be referable to Anodontosaurus lambei. It does not have any triangular osteoderms such as those present on the tail of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, but it is unclear if any of the preserved integument in ROM 813 is from the tail. At present, it is impossible to determine if ROM 813 is referable to Dyoplosaurus or Euoplocephalus. This unsatisfactory result can only be resolved by finding additional specimens with in situ integument. Systematic Paleontology\nDINOSAURIA Owen, 1842 [78]. ORNITHISCHIA Seeley, 1887 [79].

Phylogenetic Relationships Of Campanian-Maastrichtian Ankylosaurids From Alberta And Montana\nThe analysis retaining the character codings from Thompson et al. [32], Matrix 1, produced two most parsimonious trees, with the best TBR score of 276 reached 150 times out of 192 (Fig. 16). The strict consensus tree has a consistency index (CI) of 0.62, and a retention index (RI) of 0.67. The Albertan ankylosaurids Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, Dyoplosaurus, Euoplocephalus, and Scolosaurus did not form a clade, but instead formed a series of nested taxa leading towards a clade of Asian ankylosaurids (plus the North American Nodocephalosaurus). Pinacosaurus grangeri Gilmore, 1933 [82] was more closely related to Minotaurasaurus than to Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. Bootstrap and Bremer supports were low for all ankylosaurid interrelationships.\nFigure 16\nResults of phylogenetic analysis 1, retaining character state codings from Thompson et al. [32].\nStrict consensus and 50% majority rule trees shown, with frequencies, bootstrap supports, and Bremer supports. The analysis with updated codings (Matrix 2) produced six most parsimonious trees of length 254, with the best score reached one time out of eleven (Fig. 17). The strict consensus tree had a CI of 0.63 and a RI of 0.66. Again, bootstrap and Bremer supports for ankylosaurid interrelationships were low. The Albertan ankylosaurids form a polytomy that is the sister group to a clade containing Asian ankylosaurids and Nodocephalosaurus. Pinacosaurus grangeri and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus were recovered as sister taxa.\nFigure 17\nResults of phylogenetic analysis 2, modifying character state codings from Thompson et al. [32]. The final analysis incorporating new characters identified in this analysis (Matrix 3) resulted in 50 most parsimonious trees with the best TBR score of 269 reached five out of ten times (Fig. 18), with a a CI of 0.65 and a RI of 0.69. Ankylosaurid interrelationships were completely unresolved in the strict consensus tree. A reduced consensus tree also had a completely unresolved Ankylosauridae. Matrix 3 was analyzed in TAXEQ [53] to determine the amount of missing data, and to search for taxonomic equivalents. Euoplocephalus, Minotaurasaurus, and Pinacosaurus grangeri had the least amount of missing data (each under 10%), and Dyoplosaurus and Nodocephalosaurus had the most missing data (each over 75%); overall, 36% of the character matrix was missing data. Six taxa were found to have potential taxonomic equivalents (Dyoplosaurus, Minotaurasaurus, Nodocephalosaurus, Tarchia, Tianzhenosaurus, and Talarurus plicatospineus Maleev, 1952 [83]), but in all cases the equivalency was asymmetric, and so no taxa could be safely removed from the analysis.\nFigure 18\nResults of phylogenetic analysis 3, with new characters added to modified character state codings from analysis 2. In the 50% majority rule tree, Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus formed a clade in 56% of all trees. Pinacosaurus was monophyletic in 72% of all trees. Scolosaurus was recovered as the most basal ankylosaurid, but Dyoplosaurus was recovered in a clade containing Asian ankylosaurids (plus Nodocephalosaurus). Scolosaurus has a relatively long postacetabular process (character state 142-0), a feature also present in nodosaurid ankylosaurs and basal thyreophorans, which may contribute to its relatively basal placement.\nIn all three analyses, the Asian ankylosaurids (plus Nodocephalosaurus) formed a monophyletic group in the strict consensus (Analyses 1 and 2) or majority-rule (Analysis 3) trees, but the North American ankylosaurids only partly formed a monophyletic group in Analysis 3. This indicates that, at present, it is best not to consider previous synonyms of Euoplocephalus as species of Euoplocephalus, but to treat them as distinct genera. The changing topology within the Ankylosauridae across these three analyses highlights the need for careful choice of characters and character codings and the identification of additional new characters. Biogeographic And Biostratigraphic Implications\nThe results of this study indicate that ankylosaurid diversity in the Late Cretaceous of Alberta was higher than previously recognized (Fig. 19). Within the Dinosaur Park Formation, there are at least three ankylosaurid species: Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, Euoplocephalus tutus, and Scolosaurus cutleri. A recent analysis of the biostratigraphy of megaherbivorous dinosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation by Mallon et al. [18] found two main assemblage zones: Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 1 (MAZ-1), from 0 to 28 meters (mostly corresponding to the Centrosaurus-Corythosaurus faunal zone sensu [36]), and MAZ-2, from 29 to 52 meters (mostly corresponding to the Styracosaurus – Lambeosaurus faunal zone sensu [36]). MAZ-2 may also extend into the Lethbridge Coal Zone, in the uppermost part of the Dinosaur Park Formation [18], previously considered the pachyrhinosaur-Lambeosaurus magnicristatus faunal zone by Ryan and Evans [36]. Scolosaurus is currently represented by only a single specimen from either the Oldman Formation or the lower 10 m of the Dinosaur Park Formation (Fig. 1), in MAZ-1a [18]. Even with an additional specimen referred to Dyoplosaurus, this taxon is still only found in MAZ-1a as well. Euoplocephalus appears to primarily occur in MAZ-1, but two significant specimens–ROM 1930 and TMP 1997.132.1–have been recovered from the upper 30 meters of the formation. At present, ROM 1930 is best referred to Euoplocephalus. However, TMP 1997.132.1 shares several features with Anodontosaurus lambei from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and is here referred to that species. It is unusual for any Albertan dinosaur genus to be present in both the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon formations, although cf. Anchiceratops and a Pachyrhinosaurus-like ceratopsid, both otherwise known only from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, have been reported from the uppermost Dinosaur Park Formation [18],[65],[84]). At present there are no morphological features that can distinguish the upper Dinosaur Park Formation ankylosaurid from Anodontosaurus lambei. Future discoveries may yet provide evidence that the upper Dinosaur Park Formation ankylosaurid warrants taxonomic separation from Anodontosaurus lambei. Regardless, there appears to be little stratigraphic overlap between Anodontosaurus lambei and the lower Dinosaur Park Formation ankylosaurids Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, Euoplocephalus tutus, and Scolosaurus cutleri.\nFigure 19\nStratigraphic distribution of Campanian-Maastrichtian ankylosaurid species in Alberta and northwest Montana.\nIndeterminate ankylosaurid material is known from the Foremost and Oldman formations in southern Alberta. The holotype of Scolosaurus cutleri may be from the Oldman Formation or the lower Dinosaur Park Formation; ankylosaurid specimens from the Upper Two Medicine Formation of Montana are referred to Scolosaurus. Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus is known from Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 1 in the Dinosaur Park Formation. Euoplocephalus tutus has been identified from both Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 1 and Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 2 of the Dinosaur Park Formation, but is more common in Zone 1. Anodontosaurus lambei is rare in Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 2 of the Dinosaur Park Formation, with most specimens identified from the Horsethief, Morrin, and Tolman members of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. In Alberta, Ankylosaurus magniventris was present in the Scollard Formation. In contrast to the high diversity in the lower Dinosaur Park Formation, ankylosaurid specimens in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation are referable only to Anodontosaurus lambei at present. Anodontosaurus lambei was present throughout the upper part of the formation (Fig. 19). Mallon et al. [66], in an evaluation of variation within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation ceratopsid Anchiceratops, noted that this genus had a long stratigraphic range relative to other Albertan ceratopsids. Anodontosaurus lambei appears to have had a similarly long stratigraphic range.\nThe referral of ankylosaurid specimens from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana to Scolosaurus cutleri, previously known from only a single specimen from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, extends the geographic range of this taxon. For the Montanan specimens that had locality information, all were collected from the upper part of the Two Medicine Formation (Fig. 19). The uppermost part of the Two Medicine Formation (10 m below the top of the formation) was dated at 74 Ma [85], whereas the top of the Dinosaur Park Formation was dated at 74.9 Ma [47], and the top of the Oldman Formation within Dinosaur Provincial Park was dated at 76.5 Ma [47]; MOR 433 most likely occurred at a slightly younger time than most of the ankylosaurids from Dinosaur Provincial Park. Although there is uncertainty regarding the stratigraphic position of the holotype of Scolosaurus, it probably originated from at least the lowest part of the Dinosaur Park Formation, and it is possible it originated from the underlying Oldman Formation. This might suggest that the referral of specimens from the Two Medicine Formation (Oohkotokia) to Scolosaurus is incorrect. However, it is possible that the occurrence of Scolosaurus in the Two Medicine Formation and (potentially) the Oldman Formation is environmentally and ecologically related: the Oldman Formation represents the maximum regression of the Western Interior Seaway during the Campanian [47], and therefore a comparatively drier, more “upland” environment compared to the Dinosaur Park Formation. Although deposited during a transgressive phase, the Upper Two Medicine Formation represents a relatively dry environment, compared to the laterally equivalent Judith River Formation and the Dinosaur Park Formation [68]. Cranial material associated with a Scolosaurus half ring from the Dinosaur Park Formation is needed to confirm the referral of the Two Medicine ankylosaurid material to Scolosaurus rather than Oohkotokia. Until then, Oohkotokia possesses no unique characters that separate it from Scolosaurus. In Alberta, no Judithian ankylosaurid fossils have been recovered north of Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park, although ankylosaurid teeth have been collected from the Kleskun Hills locality near Grande Prairie [86]. Although the teeth are the right size to be ankylosaurid teeth, the two teeth that were recovered are weathered and may represent teeth of juvenile nodosaurids. Nodosaurid fossils have been collected from as far north as the Matanuska Formation of Alaska [87], but currently ankylosaurids appear to be restricted to more southern parts of Laramidia during the Late Cretaceous.\nNodocephalosaurus appears to have been related to the Asian ankylosaurids Saichania and Tarchia, a relationship first noted by Sullivan [50]. This is unusual, given that Nodocephalosaurus is currently known from the Campanian of New Mexico (southern Laramidia), and no northern Laramidian ankylosaurids have recently been hypothesized to have been closely related to any Asian species. It seems unusual that Asian ankylosaurid dinosaurs migrated into North America during the Late Cretaceous without leaving any close relatives in Alaska, Alberta, Montana, or Utah, through what is presumed to be the most likely dispersal route from Asia to New Mexico. The phylogenetic analysis by Thompson et al. [32], as well as Analysis 3 in this paper, recover the Albertan species Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus as having affinities with Asian ankylosaurids. Again, it is important to note that the position of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus appears to be quite labile. There is a great deal of missing data in the character matrix for this taxon, and so a close relationship between Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and Asian ankylosaurids should be regarded as tentative at best. However, if further study confirms this relationship, this could support the hypothesis of a dispersal of Asian ankylosaurids into North America during the Late Cretaceous. Conclusions\nSpecimens that were once referred to a single genus, Euoplocephalus, are now shown to represent at least four distinct taxa, greatly increasing the diversity of Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids. Within Alberta, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, Euoplocephalus tutus, and Scolosaurus cutleri were restricted to the lower part of the Dinosaur Park Formation (although Scolosaurus may have occurred in the top of the Oldman Formation), and Anodontosaurus lambei was present in the upper part of the Dinosaur Park Formation and in the Horseshoe Canyon formation. Oohkotokia horneri, from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, is morphologically indistinct from Scolosaurus cutleri. Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus has limited cranial material and is represented by only two specimens. In contrast, Anodontosaurus lambei, Euoplocephalus tutus, and Scolosaurus cutleri are known from numerous referred specimens, including both skulls and postcrania. The skeleton of Anodontosaurus lambei is not as completely known as that of Euoplocephalus tutus, for which nearly the entire skeleton is represented across numerous referred specimens. Although Euoplocephalus tutus still includes the most referred material, there is no specimen that includes in situ osteoderms, and so the arrangement of osteoderms in Euoplocephalus tutus is not known.\nThe recognition of several species within Euoplocephalus tutus sensu lato indicates that Euoplocephalus tutus sensu stricto was not as intraspecifically variable as previously suspected. Although cranial ornamentation can be variable, aspects of ankylosaurid cranial ornamentation are taxonomically informative, such as the overall shapes of the squamosal horns, the presence or absence of postocular caputegulae at the bases of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns, the morphology of the first cervical half ring, and the shape and proportions of the tail club knob. The morphology of the pelvis also appears to be taxonomically informative. Conversely, certain aspects of the cranial and postcranial skeleton, such as squamosal horn size and bluntness, cranial caputegulum distinctness, cervical half ring anteroposterior length, and robustness of limb elements (such as the size of the deltopectoral crest of the humerus) are more likely a result of ontogenetic variation. This information can be used to better interpret taxonomic versus intraspecific variation among other ankylosaurid taxa."],"prob":["lesion, mm, area, cm, diamet, locat, right"],"frex":["canal, cyst,

From 28 of these bulls, blood samples were also obtained. Deficient levels of copper were found in plasma, livers, kidneys and semitendinosus muscles. Suboptimal selenium concentrations were found in plasma and semitendinosus muscles. Semitendinosus muscles contained high iron concentrations. Trace elements were mainly stored in the liver, except for iron and selenium. Cardiac muscles generally contained higher concentrations of trace elements than semitendinous muscles except for zinc. A strong association was found between liver and kidney concentrations of copper, iron, cobalt and molybdenum. Liver storage was well correlated with storage in semitendinosus muscle for selenium and with cardiac muscle for cobalt and selenium. Plasma concentrations of copper, selenium, cobalt were well related with their respective liver concentrations and for cobalt and selenium, also with cardiac muscle concentrations. The data suggest multiple trace element deficiencies in zebu cattle in South-West Ethiopia, with lowered tissue concentrations as a consequence.

Besides, the transport and uptake of ginsenosides were also investigated on Caco-2 cell in the absence and presence of verapamil to further confirm which ginsenosides were P-gp subtrates. In order to verify the reliability of the cell models, digoxin was used as a positive control drug during the whole course of the experiment. The effects of P-gp inhibitor (verapamil) on Ginsenosides transport in cultured LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cells\nThe effect of verapamil (a classical P-gp inhibitor) on the transport ability of ginsenosides has been investigated in LLC-PK1 cells and the derived cell line L-MDR1. Figure 2(A) illustrates the ERs of digoxin (positive control drug), ginsenoside Rh1, F1, Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Re, Rd, Rb1 and Rg1 on LLC-PK1 cells (lacking P-gp), in the absence and presence of 10 µM verapamil as a P-gp inhibitor. No transport difference was observed when verapamil was added, and the efflux level of digoxin and ginsenosides across LLC-PK1 cell monolayer in the absorptive (AP→BL) was similar to the secretive (BL→AP) directions. It was mean that the ER of ginsenosides across LLC-PK1 cell monolayer and the corresponding Papp values were not affected by verapamil. On the other hand, we also compared the transport of digoxin, ginsenoside Rh1, F1, Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Re, Rd, Rb1 and Rg1 on L-MDR1 cells (LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected with the human MDR1 gene), in the absence and presence of 10 µM verapamil as P-gp inhibitor (shown in Figure 2(B)). Obviously, the ERs of digoxin, ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 on L-MDR1 cells were 26.23, 5.14, 4.12, 4.20, 4.71, 8.22 and 6.69, respectively (far greater than 2.0). Moreover, the addition of verapamil caused a significantly decrease of ER through increasing the transport of digoxin, ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 in the AP→BL direction, and decreasing their transport across L-MDR1 cell monolayers in the BL→AP direction. For the other ginsenosides (Rh1, F1, Re and Rg1), the ERs across L-MDR1 cells were lower than 2.0, and the corresponding Papp values were almost not affected by verapamil (P>0.05).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098717.g002Figure 2\nThe effect of verapamil on the efflux ratio of digoxin, ginsenoside Rh1, F1, Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Re, Rd, Rb1 and Rg1 on LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cell.\n(A) The efflux ratio of digoxin and ginsenosides on LLC-PK1 cells in the absence and presence of verapamil.

The effects of verapamil on the uptake of ginsenosides in cultured LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cells\nHerein, we examined the effect of verapamil on the uptake of ginsenosides on LLC-PK1 cells and the derived cell line L-MDR1. As shown in Figure 3(A), intracellular accumulation of digoxin, ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 on LLC-PK1 cells had no significant difference in the absence and presence of verapamil. In contrast, the intracellular concentrations of digoxin, ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 on L-MDR1 cells were greatly increased in the presence of P-gp inhibitor verapamil (Figure 3(B)), and the uptake levels of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 were enhanced by 3.2-, 1.7-, 1.5-, 1.6-, 1.5-, 1.8 and 2.6- fold in the presence of 10 µM verapamil, respectively (P<0.05).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098717.g003Figure 3\nThe effect of verapamil on the uptake of ginsenosides in LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cell and the effect of verapamil on the uptake and transport of digoxin and ginsenosides in Caco-2 cell.\n(A) The concentration of digoxin and ginsenosides in LLC-PK1 cell in the absence and presence of verapamil.

The effects of verapamil on the transport and uptake of ginsenosides in Caco-2 cell\nCaco-2 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, had demonstrated numerous morphological and biochemical characteristics of enterocytes with a well-developed brush border and associated enzymes and transporters [32]. Herein, we studied the effect of verapamil on the transport ability of ginsenosides in Caco-2 cell. Figure 3(C) illustrates the ERs of digoxin, ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1in Caco-2 cells, in the absence and presence of 10 µM verapamil as P-gp inhibitor. Ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 exhibited highly polarized transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers with marked efflux ratio value at 3.23, 4.42, 4.36, 4.26, 3.85, 4.47 and 3.77, respectively, which were far greater than 2.0, and their high efflux ratios were decreased significantly in the presence of 10 µM verapamil. In addition, the effect of verapamil on the uptake of ginsenosides had been investigated, and the results are shown in Figure 3(D). The uptake of digoxin, ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 was found can be significantly enhanced by verapamil.\nIn summary, the results above indicated that the ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 were moderate P-gp substrates, and ginsenosides Rh1, F1, Re, and Rg1 almost could not be transported by P-gp. The effects of SLE on ginsenosides transport and uptake\nAccording to our previous study [22], SLE was a strong P-gp inhibitor, and could significantly decrease the ERs of P-gp substrates (digoxin and vincrisine) in L-MDR1 and Caco-2 cells. Herein, the effects of SLE on the transport and uptake of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 would be investigated since these ginsenosides were been proven as moderate P-gp substrates based on the experiments above. Inhibition of ginsenosides transport by SLE in cultured LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cells\nHerein, we investigated the effect of SLE on the transport of ginsenosides to explore the compatibility rule between ginsenosides and SLE in Shengmai-san based on P-gp. Figure 4(A) illustrates the absorptive (AP→BL) and secretory (BL→AP) transport of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin on LLC-PK1 cells (lacking P-gp), in the absence and presence of SLE (2.0 and 10.0 µg/mL) as P-gp inhibitor. No transport difference was observed when SLE was added. It was mean that the efflux of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin across LLC-PK1 cell monolayer in the absorptive (AP→BL) and secretory (BL→AP) directions and the corresponding Papp values were not affected by SLE. On the other hand, we also compared the transport of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin on L-MDR1 cells, in the absence and presence of SLE (2.0 and 10.0 µg/mL) as P-gp inhibitor (shown in Figure 4(B)). Obviously, the ERs of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin could be significantly decreased by SLE.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098717.g004Figure 4\nThe effect of SLE on the uptake and transport of digoxin and ginsenosides in LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cell.\n(A) The transport of digoxin and ginsenosides on LLC-PK1 cell in the absence and presence of SLE at 2.0 µg/mL (L) and 10.0 µg/mL (H).

The Effect of SLE on the uptake of ginsenosides in cultured LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1 cells\nHerein, we examined the effect of SLE on the uptake of ginsenosides on LLC-PK1 cells and the derived cell line L-MDR1. As shown in Figure 4(C), intracellular accumulation of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin on LLC-PK1 cells had no significant difference in the absence and presence of SLE. In contrast, SLE concentration dependently increased intracellular concentrations of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 in L-MDR1 cells. When 2.0 µg/mL SLE was added, the intracellular concentrations of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin in L-MDR1 cells were increased by 2.0-, 1.9-, 1.7-, 2.5-, 2.9, 2.9 and 2.7- fold. The intracellular concentrations of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd, Rb1 and digoxin in L-MDR1 cells were increased by 3.7-, 3.5-, 2.1-, 2.9-, 4.3, 5.1-, and 3.6- fold with the presence of 10.0 µg/mL SLE (Figure 4(D)). Inhibition of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 transport across Caco-2 monolayer by SLE\nThe ability of SLE to affect the transport of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells. Ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 exhibited highly polarized transport across Caco-2 cell monolayer with marked efflux ratio values at 4.42, 4.36, 4.26, 3.85, 4.47 and 3.77, respectively, which were far greater than 2.0, and the presence of SLE could concentration dependently decrease the transport capability of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 across Caco-2 monolayer in the BL-AP direction, which correspondingly led to the decrease in efflux ratios (As shown in Figure 5(A)).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098717.g005Figure 5\nThe effect of SLE on the transport and uptake of digoxin and ginsenosides in Caco-2 cell.\n(A) The transport of digoxin and ginsenosides on Caco-2 cell in the absence and presence of SLE at 2.0 µg/mL (L) and 10.0 µg/mL (H).

Enhancing uptake of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 by SLE in Caco-2 cell\nThe effect of SLE on the uptake of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 had been investigated and the results are shown in Figure 5(B)). SLE could concentration dependently increase intracellular concentrations of ginsenoside Rb2, Rc, Rg2, Rg3, Rd and Rb1 in Caco-2 cells when 2.0 and 10.0 µg/mL of SLE were loaded (P<0.01). Single-dose SLE increased plasma concentrations of ginsenosides in rats\nIn this process, the effect of single-dose SLE on the plasma pharmacokinetics of ginsenosides in rats was investigated. The plasma concentration of ginsenosides after intragastric administration of GE at the dose of 150 mg/kg or in combination with SLE was determined by LC/MS. As a result, ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd were the main components in rat plasma, and the exposure of ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd was much higher than other components. The plasma concentration-time profiles of ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd are shown in Figure 6 and their pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 1. Obviously, coadministration of SLE could evidently increase the AUC0-∞ of ginsenoside Rb2 for 2.18-fold, from 10551.63±1728.81 ng.h/mL in the vehicle treated group to 23198.61±5566.23 ng.h/mL in the SLE-treated group (P<0.01). For ginsenoside Rc and Rd, similarly, coadministration of SLE could increase the AUC for 1.49-fold and 1.86-fold (P<0.05). For ginsenoside Rb1, coadministration of SLE could increase the AUC for 1.29-fold, but no statistical difference was found between the two groups after carrying t test (P>0.05). Besides, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) for Rb1 and Rb2 were also significantly enhanced by SLE treatment (P<0.05), and Cmax of ginsenoside Rc and Rd was not dramatically changed after SLE treatment. At the same time, the time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and half-life time (t1/2) were not altered after coadministration of SLE. As a positive control, the effect of single-dose SLE on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in rats was investigated. The plasma concentration-time profiles when digoxin was single administered alone or in combination with SLE at 500 mg/kg are shown in Fig. 6 and the pharmacokinetic parameters are list in Table 1. Obviously, coadministration of SLE could significantly increase the AUC0-τ of digoxin 1.25-fold, from 61.80±13.37 ng.h/mL in the vehicle treated group to 84.38±7.25 ng.h/mL in the SLE-treated group.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098717.g006Figure 6\nThe plasma concentration-time profiles of digoxin and ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd after single-dose of vehicle / SLE and GE.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098717.t001Table 1\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin and ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd after single ig SLE and 150/kg GE in rats (n = 5).

On the 11th day, GE was administered to rats at a single dose of 150 mg/kg by gavage. As shown in Figure 7, 10 continuous days administration of SLE could increase the AUC0-∞ of ginsenoside Rb2 for 1.33-fold, from 22557.12±6121.56 ng.h/mL in the vehicle treated group to 16600.84±3511.26 ng.h/mL in the SLE-treated group, but no statistical difference was found between the two groups after carrying t test (P>0.05). For ginsenoside Rc and Rd, similarly, coadministration of SLE could increase the AUC for 1.16-fold and 1.60-fold. Besides, 10 continuous days administration of SLE could increase the AUC0-∞ of ginsenoside Rb1 1.82-fold, from 14324.65±5178.69 ng.h/mL in the vehicle treated group to 27017.32±2381.53 ng.h/mL in the SLE-treated group (P<0.01).

Yet there is little information describing the antimicrobial concentrations at the site of action. The objective of this study was to compare the active drug concentrations in the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid and interstitial fluid of four antimicrobials commonly used in cattle. After injection, plasma, interstitial fluid, and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid concentrations and protein binding were measured to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of each drug. A cross-over design with six calves per drug was used. Following sample collection and drug analysis, pharmacokinetic calculations were performed. For enrofloxacin and metabolite ciprofloxacin, the interstitial fluid concentration was 52% and 78% of the plasma concentration, while pulmonary fluid concentrations was 24% and 40% of the plasma concentration, respectively. The pulmonary concentrations (enrofloxacin + ciprofloxacin combined) exceeded the MIC90 of 0.06 μg/mL at 48 hours after administration. For florfenicol, the interstitial fluid concentration was almost 98% of the plasma concentration, and the pulmonary concentrations were over 200% of the plasma concentrations, exceeding the breakpoint (≤ 2 μg/mL), and the MIC90 for Mannheimia haemolytica (1.0 μg/mL) for the duration of the study. For ceftiofur, penetration to the interstitial fluid was only 5% of the plasma concentration. Pulmonary epithelial lining fluid concentration represented 40% of the plasma concentration. Airway concentrations exceeded the MIC breakpoint for susceptible respiratory pathogens (≤ 2 μg/mL) for a short time at 48 hours after administration. The plasma and interstitial fluid concentrations of tulathromcyin were lower than the concentrations in pulmonary fluid throughout the study. The bronchial concentrations were higher than the plasma or interstitial concentrations, with over 900% penetration to the airways.

It is normally treated with high dose steroids, but its recurrent nature leads to prolonged steroid usage and associated side effects. There is little evidence on the efficacy of alternative treatments for ENL, especially for patients who have become steroid resistant or have steroid side effects. These two pilot studies compare the efficacy and side effect profile of ciclosporin plus prednisolone against prednisolone alone in the treatment of patients with either new ENL or chronic and recurrent ENL. Methods and Results: Thirteen patients with new ENL and twenty patients with chronic ENL were recruited into two double-blinded randomised controlled trials. Patients were randomised to receive ciclosporin and prednisolone or prednisolone treatment only. Patients with acute ENL had a delay of 16 weeks in the occurrence of ENL flare-up episode, with less severe flare-ups and decreased requirements for additional prednisolone. Patients with chronic ENL on ciclosporin had the first episode of ENL flare-up 4 weeks earlier than those on prednisolone, as well as more severe ENL flare-ups requiring 2.5 times more additional prednisolone. Adverse events attributable to prednisolone were more common that those attributable to ciclosporin. Conclusions: This is the first clinical trial on ENL management set in the African context, and also the first trial in leprosy to use patients’ assessment of outcomes. Patients on ciclosporin showed promising results in the management of acute ENL in this small pilot study. But ciclosporin, did not appear to have a significant steroid–sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL, which may have been due to the prolonged use of steroids in these patients in combination with a too rapid decrease of steroids in patients given ciclosporin. Further research is needed to determine whether the promising results of ciclosporin in acute ENL can be reproduced on a larger scale. Author Summary: Leprosy is caused by a mycobacterium, and is curable with multi-drug therapy, a combination of antibiotics taken for 6 or 12 months. However, some leprosy patients develop an inflammatory condition known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or Type 2 reaction. ENL affects multiple organs and causes systemic illness as well as nerve damage that leads to disability and deformity. ENL is often chronic and patients have multiple flare-ups requiring prolonged steroid treatment. Patients are at risk of developing adverse events related to long term steroids. There are no effective, non-teratogenic alternative treatments for patients who no longer respond to steroids or have contra-indications to steroids. We conducted two studies to see if ciclosporin, an immunosuppressant used in many inflammatory conditions, could safely be used either as an alternative or in conjunction with prednisolone to treat ENL. Patients with acute ENL showed promising results with ciclosporin treatment, with a 16 week median delay in recurrence of ENL. It did not however appear to have a significant steroid–sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL. This suggests that further ENL studies should look at carefully tailored regimens of medication in order to assess the effect of ciclosporin or other immunosuppressant drugs."],"prob":["treatment, therapi, treat, month, effect, combin, efficaci"],"frex":["treatment, therapi, regimen, efficaci, treat, cure, relaps"],"lift":["enl, ciclosporin, second-lin, flare-up, third-lin, monotherapi, post-treat"],"score":["treatment, therapi, regimen, treat, month, efficaci, drug"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["dose, day, week, administ, daili, ae, dosag"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[92],"thought_1":["Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the combination of oral vinorelbine with erlotinib using the conventional (CSV) and metronomic (MSV) dosing schedules in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: This was an open-label, multiple dose-escalation phase I study. An alternating 3+3 phase I design was employed to allow each schedule to enroll three patients sequentially at each dose level. Thirty patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were treated with escalating doses of oral vinorelbine starting at 40 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 in the CSV group (N = 16) and at 100 mg/week in the MSV group (N = 14). Erlotinib was administered orally daily. Results: The maximum tolerated dose was vinorelbine 80 mg/m2 with erlotinib 100 mg in the CSV group and vinorelbine 120 mg/week with erlotinib 100 mg in the MSV group. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (N = 2; 13%) and hyponatremia (N = 1; 6%) in the CSV group, and neutropenia (N = 5; 36%) in the MSV group. Objective response was achieved in 38% and 29% in the CSV and MSV groups respectively. Vinorelbine co-administration did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib and OSI-420 after initial dose. However, at steady-state, significantly higher Cmax, higher Cmin and lower CL/F of erlotinib were observed with increasing dose levels of vinorelbine in the CSV group. Significantly higher steady-state Cmin, Cavg and AUCss of erlotinib were observed with increasing dose levels of vinorelbine in the MSV group. Conclusions: Combination of oral vinorelbine with erlotinib is feasible and tolerable in both the CSV and MSV groups.

Methods: In total, 48 patients aged 18 to 75 years with moderate to severe stable chronic plaque psoriasis with affected body surface area ≥15% and physician global assessment score ≥3 were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation trial. Patients were randomized within each single dose cohort (0.01, 0.05, 0.2, 0.6, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg) or multiple dose cohort (0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg; 1 dose every other week for 7 weeks) of NNC0109-0012 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. In the expansion phase, 7 patients were randomized to weekly doses of 2.0 mg/kg NNC0109-0012 or placebo for 7 weeks. The primary objective, safety and tolerability, was assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs). Additional endpoints included pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response (assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score). Results: AEs were reported in 85% of patients (n = 40) in the initial study phases (NNC0109-0012, 83%; placebo, 92%) and in 4 of 7 patients in the multiple-dose expansion phase. One serious AE was reported but was judged not to be causally related to NNC0109-0012. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. NNC0109-0012 pharmacokinetics was similar to other monoclonal antibodies, with an average half-life of approximately 3 weeks. There was a dose-proportional increase in area under the curve and maximum concentration after single dosing. No substantial changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed. The expansion phase was terminated early due to apparent lack of PASI improvement. Conclusion: Single and multiple doses of NNC0109-0012, ranging from 0.05 to 3.0 mg/kg, were well tolerated in patients with psoriasis and exhibited pharmacokinetics similar to that of other monoclonal antibodies.

Conclusion: In an older population, we observed an increased stomach cancer risk in male short sleepers and suggestive associations with short or long sleep duration for many cancer risks in both genders."],"prob":["ci, associ, risk, studi, adjust, age, tabl"],"frex":["ci, adjust, odd, yes, multivari, ref, confid"],"lift":["badjust, aadjust, adjusteda, p-trend, unadjust, ref, ci"],"score":["ci, risk, adjust, odd, yes, age, associ"],"proportion":["0.02"]},{"name":["tobacco, drink, cigarett, pollut, food, consumpt, eat"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[50],"thought_1":["The Association between Alcohol Exposure and Self-Reported Health Status: The Effect of Separating Former and Current Drinkers"],"thought_2":["Impact of the Spanish Smoke-Free Legislation on Adult, Non-Smoker Exposure to Secondhand Smoke: Cross-Sectional Surveys before (2004) and after (2012) Legislation"],"prob":["exposur, smoke, food, alcohol, intak, consumpt, drink"],"frex":["tobacco, drink, cigarett, pollut, food, consumpt, eat"],"lift":["smoke-fre, pizza, sugar-sweeten, pasta, energy-adjust, ffq, cola"],"score":["smoke, food, intak, alcohol, exposur, smoker, consumpt"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["femal, popul, male, year, adult, children, age"],"children":[{"name":["urban, incom, socioeconom, inequ, rural, counti, ses"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[22],"thought_1":["Race, Ethnicity, Language, Social Class, and Health Communication Inequalities: A Nationally-Representative Cross-Sectional Study"],"thought_2":["Socioeconomic Status and Health Communication Inequalities in Japan: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Survey"],"prob":["health, popul, among, school, educ, area, preval"],"frex":["urban, incom, socioeconom, inequ, rural, counti, ses"],"lift":["walkabl, county-level, accultur, ncms, hukou, area-level, rural-to-urban"],"score":["household, urban, rural, incom, school, educ, health"],"proportion":["0.02"]},{"name":["young, older, femal, adolesc, younger, male, childhood"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[59],"thought_1":["Early Life Origins of Lung Ageing: Early Life Exposures and Lung Function Decline in Adulthood in Two European Cohorts Aged 28-73 Years"],"thought_2":["Obesity and Life Expectancy with and without Diabetes in Adults Aged 55 Years and Older in the Netherlands: A Prospective Cohort Study"],"prob":["age, year, children, male, femal, adult, month"],"frex":["young, older, femal, adolesc, younger, male, childhood"],"lift":["boy, girl, preschool, pubert, childhood, children.th, haz"],"score":["children, age, year, male, femal, older, adolesc"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[22,59]},{"name":["survey, health, question, inform, particip, interview, respond"],"children":[{"name":["attitud, belief, know, think, said, want, caregiv"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[63],"thought_1":["Acceptability of Financial Incentives for Health Behaviours: A Discrete Choice Experiment"],"thought_2":["Engaging Terminally Ill Patients in End of Life Talk: How Experienced Palliative Medicine Doctors Navigate the Dilemma of Promoting Discussions about Dying"],"prob":["health, knowledg, student, famili, communiti, peopl, educ"],"frex":["attitud, belief, know, think, said, want, caregiv"],"lift":["i’m, you’r, i’v, yeah, they’r, i’d, you’v"],"score":["attitud, educ, health, social, perceiv, doctor, communiti"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["answer, interview, question, ask, invit, phone, agre"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[91],"thought_1":["Background: Consent forms have lengthened over time and become harder for participants to understand. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a simplified consent form for biobanking that comprises the minimum information necessary to meet ethical and regulatory requirements. We then gathered preliminary data concerning its content from hypothetical biobank participants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We followed basic principles of plain-language writing and incorporated into a 2-page form (not including the signature page) those elements of information required by federal regulations and recommended by best practice guidelines for biobanking. We then recruited diabetes patients from community-based practices and randomized half (n = 56) to read the 2-page form, first on paper and then a second time on a tablet computer. Participants were encouraged to use “More information” buttons on the electronic version whenever they had questions or desired further information. These buttons led to a series of “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQs) that contained additional detailed information. Participants were asked to identify specific sentences in the FAQs they thought would be important if they were considering taking part in a biorepository. On average, participants identified 7 FAQ sentences as important (mean 6.6, SD 14.7, range: 0–71). No one sentence was highlighted by a majority of participants; further, 34 (60.7%) participants did not highlight any FAQ sentences. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that our 2-page form contains the information that most prospective participants identify as important. Combining simplified forms with supplemental material for those participants who desire more information could help minimize consent form length and complexity, allowing the most substantively material information to be better highlighted and enabling potential participants to read the form and ask questions more effectively."],"thought_2":["Study Design A Delphi technique to obtain expert consensus on the content of a scale for assessment of ultrasound skills was used for this study. The Delphi technique is an anonymous structured approach, in which information is gathered from a group of participants (e.g. ultrasound experts) through a number of Delphi rounds. In the first round, participants evaluate and comment a number of elements of interest. Based on the group response, participants then re-evaluate these elements in subsequent Delphi rounds. This process is repeated until consensus has been reached. The web-based, anonymous nature of the Delphi technique ensures that a single individual cannot dominate the consensus formation and all participants are equally able to change their opinion in the course of the process [5]–[9]. The study originated from the Juliane Marie Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Denmark from February to May 2012. Written consent was obtained from all participants by e-mail and ethical approval from the regional ethical committee of the Capital Region (Protocol-number H-2-2012-038), Copenhagen, Denmark, was obtained before conducting the study. Selection of Experts and Specialties Experts were identified according to selection criteria described by Palter et al. [8], [9] Criteria for inclusion in our study were that the experts: 1) were regarded as leaders in their field of practice, 2) actively practiced ultrasound on a regular basis and were involved in post-graduate training, 3) had strong publication records in ultrasound imaging, and finally 4) represented a broad geographical area including North America, Europe, and Australia. There is no consensus on the number of experts required for a Delphi study, [8] although previous studies have used 5–10 participants from each professional group. [10] Consequently, a total of 60 experts from the following six specialties were invited: Radiology, Obstetrics-Gynaecology, Emergency Medicine, Rheumatology, Gastro-Enterology, and Surgery including Urology. A group of six leading members of the international ultrasound societies representing different specialties helped identify these 60 experts based on the criteria mentioned above. Drafting the Elements for the First Delphi Round Key elements of the ultrasound examination were identified prior to the first Delphi round by reviewing existing research on imaging perception and assessment theory along with recommendations provided by the European and American ultrasound societies. [11]-[19] These sources of information were triangulated into a new framework containing seven key elements that formed the starting point of the first Delphi round. All elements were provided with short explanations and examples. The First Delphi Round The experts agreed to participate by completing the first Delphi round consisting of an anonymised questionnaire. In this questionnaire, the experts were instructed to rate and, if relevant, comment the seven key elements on how important they consider them to be for assessment of trainees’ ultrasound skills. Each element was rated on a five-point Likert scale that was provided with response anchors (1 = Not relevant; 3 = Relevant but not essential; 5 = Essential). Finally, experts were encouraged to suggest up to three new elements that should be considered for assessment of ultrasound skills. All experts were contacted by e-mail. In each of the three rounds they had four weeks to respond during which two e-mail reminders at two-week intervals were sent to non-responders. The Second Delphi Round All ratings from the first Delphi round were analysed and distributions of scores were presented in percent for each element. Any comments on elements from the first round were analysed and the descriptions of elements were re-phrased in case of ambiguity. Thus, the content of the elements remained unchanged but clarification of the wordings was allowed. All proposed new elements from the first round were categorized by two of the authors (MT & AT). New elements were coded and classified into groups describing similar subject matter. [20] Groups of elements that were proposed by more than 10% of the expert panel were included as new elements in the second Delphi round. In the second Delphi round, the experts were informed about the distribution of scores and selected comments from the other members of the panel produced in the first Delphi round. They were instructed to re-consider the elements presented in the first round as well as to rate and comment the new elements the same way as in the first round. The final content of the assessment instrument was based on consensus obtained after the second Delphi round. In previous Delphi studies, consensus was defined as more than 80% of the experts supporting an element. [7], [21], [22] Hence, an element was included when more than 80% of the experts regarded it as essential, which corresponded to an element being rated four or five out of five on importance for assessment of ultrasound skills. No elements were excluded between the first to the second round. This was done to allow experts to revise their opinion on elements from the first round when considering the ratings and comments provided by the other members of the expert panel. The Third Delphi Round The elements included in the assessment instrument were given response anchors on five-point Likert scales. In the third round, participants were also provided the opportunity to comment the final outline of the assessment instrument including the response anchors. These comments were used to avoid ambiguity of response anchors and to ensure that the scores were aligned to similar performance characteristics through the rating scale. Even in case of no comments, all experts were asked to reply to monitor response rates. Statistical Analysis All data were handled in SPSS ver. 19.0. Frequency of scores was calculated for each Delphi round. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare groups for differences between specialties and nationalities in the two first Delphi rounds and a post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni corrections was performed. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare ratings of the elements between the first and second Delphi round. Missing data points were excluded from comparative analysis listwise."],"prob":["particip, survey, question, interview, inform, respond, questionnair"],"frex":["answer, interview, question, ask, invit, phone, agre"],"lift":["tape-record, surveymonkey, memo, maxqda, ethicist, audio-record, atlas.ti"],"score":["particip, interview, questionnair, survey, ask, respond, question"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[63,91]},{"name":["score, disord, depress, mental, scale, symptom, assess"],"children":[{"name":["antidepress, depress, antipsychot, suicid, schizophrenia, psychiatr, violenc"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[13],"thought_1":["Internet Addiction and Relationships with Insomnia, Anxiety, Depression, Stress and Self-Esteem in University Students: A Cross-Sectional Designed Study"],"thought_2":["Longitudinal Associations between Adolescent Psychotic Experiences and Depressive Symptoms"],"prob":["depress, disord, symptom, mental, use, anxieti, studi"],"frex":["antidepress, depress, antipsychot, suicid, schizophrenia, psychiatr, violenc"],"lift":["psychot, ssris, mirtazapin, non-suicid, depression-rel, ideat, psychopharmacolog"],"score":["depress, mental, anxieti, disord, suicid, schizophrenia, symptom"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["subscal, hrqol, qol, score, item, scale, psychometr"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[78],"thought_1":["Psychometric Assessment of the Japanese Version of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ): Reliability and Validity"],"thought_2":["Assessing the Validity of Self-Rated Health with the Short Physical Performance Battery: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the International Mobility in Aging Study"],"prob":["score, scale, assess, item, function, cognit, measur"],"frex":["subscal, hrqol, qol, score, item, scale, psychometr"],"lift":["subscal, hrqol, hrql, iadl, alexithymia, srmr, 15-item"],"score":["score, item, cognit, subscal, questionnair, hrqol, qol"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[13,78]},{"name":["journal, citat, scientist, news, articl, fund, advertis"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[3],"thought_1":["On the 25th of February 2011, the State Medical Association of Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, informed all affected medical journals of the results of its evaluation regarding the status of Institutional Review Board approval for research conducted by the anaesthetist Dr. Joachim Boldt. The evaluation revealed that 88 original articles authored by Dr. Boldt, and published in 18 peer-reviewed journals, lacked formal ethical approval. As a consequence, the editors-in-chief of these 18 journals signed a common statement declaring their intention to retract these articles from their journals, and to publish formal retraction notices [1].Authoritative bodies such as the Committee On Publication Ethics (COPE) [2], and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) [3] have produced guidelines concerning the retraction of fraudulent research papers. According to COPE, retraction notices should be published and linked to the retracted article, be clearly identified as a retraction (not as a correction or a comment), identify the retracted article by including the title and authors in the retraction heading, explain who is retracting and the reasons for retraction, and finally, be freely accessible to all reader, thus not be hidden behind access barriers [4]. NLM adds a statement stipulating that “The retraction should appear on a numbered page in a prominent section in an issue of the print journal that published the retracted article as well as in the online version, be listed in the Table of Contents page.” NLM does not remove the original reference of a retracted article, but updates the citation to indicate it has been retracted and adds a link to the retraction statement. The original article should be retained unchanged, except for a watermark on the PDF indicating on each page that it is “retracted”. Sox and Rennie have further recommended that, as with retraction notices, journals should provide free access to the full text of retracted fraudulent articles [5].In earlier cases, some occurring before these recommendations were published, journals were found not to have retracted articles appropriately [5], [6]. Although the importance of appropriately retracting fraudulent articles has often been underlined in Commentaries and Editorials [7]–[9], studies attempting to quantify the problem are still lacking. We therefore set out to study the fate of the 88 articles by Dr. Joachim Boldt that were meant to be retracted in early summer 2011 because of lack of ethical approval."],"thought_2":["Patenting of University and Non-University Public Research Organisations in Germany: Evidence from Patent Applications for Medical Research Results"],"prob":["research, journal, public, articl, publish, author, review"],"frex":["journal, citat, scientist, news, articl, fund, advertis"],"lift":["twitter, bibliometr, icmj, authorship, blog, jcr, industry-sponsor"],"score":["journal, articl, citat, fund, research, guidelin, public"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["trial, studi, intervent, report, outcom, review, effect"],"children":[{"name":["trial, placebo, intervent, randomis, arm, clinicaltrials.gov, random"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[16],"thought_1":["Analysis of Group Randomized Trials with Multiple Binary Endpoints and Small Number of Groups"],"thought_2":["Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690417 Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01049048"],"prob":["trial, intervent, effect, outcom, group, control, random"],"frex":["trial, placebo, intervent, randomis, arm, clinicaltrials.gov, random"],"lift":["placebo, controlled-trials.com, intention-to-treat, www.controlled-trials.com, parallel-group, double-dummi, csrs"],"score":["trial, intervent, placebo, rcts, outcom, baselin, arm"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["i2, cochran, meta-analysi, nr, systemat, bias, srs"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[62],"thought_1":["Systematic Review of the Empirical Evidence of Study Publication Bias and Outcome Reporting Bias — An Updated Review"],"thought_2":["Background: Use of a risk of bias (ROB) tool has been encouraged and advocated to reviewers writing systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs). Selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias are included in the Cochrane ROB tool. It is important to know how this specific tool for assessing ROB has been applied since its release. Our objectives were to evaluate whether and to what extent the new Cochrane ROB tool has been used in Chinese journal papers of acupuncture. Methods: We searched CBM, TCM database, CJFD, CSJD, and the Wanfang Database from inception to March 2011. Two reviewers independently selected SRs that primarily focused on acupuncture and moxibustion, from which the data was extracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 836 SRs were identified from the search, of which, 105 were included and four are awaiting assessment. Thirty-six of the 105 SRs were published before release of the Cochrane ROB tool (up to 2009). Most used the Cochrane Handbook 4.2 or Jadad's scale for risk or quality assessment. From 2009 to March 2011 69 SRs were identified. While “risk of bias” was reported for approximately two-thirds of SRs, only two SRs mentioned use of a “risk of bias tool” in their assessment. Only 5.8% (4/69) of reviews reported information on all six domains which are involved in the ROB tool. A risk of bias graph/summary figure was provided in 2.9% (2/69) of reviews. Most SRs gave information about sequence generation, allocation concealment, blindness, and incomplete outcome data, however, few reviews (5.8%; 4/69) described selective reporting or other potential sources of bias. Conclusions: The Cochrane “risk of bias” tool has not been used in all SRs/MAs of acupuncture published in Chinese Journals after 2008.

Overall, the proportions of formulations with CDSCO approval after 1 May 2002 were unchanged compared with before 1 May 2002. The proportions of formulations with CDSCO approval increased for NSAID FDCs (26% to 28%) and anti-psychotic FDCs (0% to 38%) and decreased for metformin FDCs (100% to 75%) and anti-depressant/benzodiazepine FDCs (20% to 18%) (Table 1).\nWith the exception of the NSAID FDC aspirin + caffeine, none of the FDCs on the market in the therapeutic areas examined were included in the Indian Pharmacopoeia [22]. FDC formulations marketed and approved in India, the UK, and the US\nThere were 124 NSAID formulations on the market in India (2011–2012), of which 34 (27%) were approved in India, six in the UK, and ten in the US (Table 1); 25 metformin FDC formulations in India, of which 20 were approved in India (80%), eight in the UK, and ten in the US; 16 anti-depressant/benzodiazepine FDC formulations in India, of which three (19%) were approved in India, none in the UK, and one in the US; and ten anti-psychotic FDC formulations in India, of which three (30%) were approved in India, none in the UK, and one in the US. All the formulations available in the UK and US in each therapeutic area were approved by the respective regulators. Formulations for which there was no record of CDSCO approval continued to be marketed after 1 May 2002; less than half of NSAID, anti-depressant/benzodiazepine, and anti-psychotic FDC formulations and 75% of metformin FDC formulations marketed after that date had records of CDSCO approval.\nOf NSAID FDC formulations, 2/6 approved in the UK and 7/10 approved in the US were not found in India (UK: ibuprofen + phenylephrine, ketoprofen + omeprazole; US: ibuprofen + diphenhydramine, ibuprofen + famotidine, ibuprofen + hydrocodone, ibuprofen + oxycodone, ibuprofen + phenylephrine, naproxen + esomeprazole, naproxen + pseudoephedrine). Of metformin FDC formulations, two were recently approved in the UK and the US and were not found in India (metformin + alogliptin [2013], metformin + canagliflozin [2014]). One anti-depressant/benzodiazepine FDC approved in the US (amitriptyline + chlordiazepoxide) was also available in India but was not included in the CDSCO’s list of approved FDCs. One anti-psychotic FDC approved in the US (amitriptyline + perphenazine) was unavailable in both the UK and India. FDC Products Arising from Unapproved Formulations\nIndividual formulations gave rise to multiple branded products. On average, the ratio of formulations to products was around 1:20 (Table 1), but several formulations had many more products (Tables 2–4 and S2). The 124 NSAID FDC formulations gave rise to 2,739 products (excluding “other”), 25 metformin formulations to 536 products, 16 anti-depressant/benzodiazepine formulations to 301 products, and ten anti-psychotic formulations to 211 products. Overall, unapproved formulations gave rise to substantial proportions of branded products for all groups except metformin FDCs: 43% of NSAID FDC products, 76% of anti-depressant/benzodiazepine FDC products, 78% of anti-psychotic FDC products, and 2% of metformin FDC products (Table 1 and Fig 1) 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001826.g001\nFig 1 Proportions of formulations on the market, products on the market, sales volume, and sales value in each therapeutic area arising from formulations unapproved by the CDSCO.\n*Excludes “other” formulations. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001826.t002\nTable 2 Metformin FDC formulations marketed in India.

Note: To avoid double-counting, FDCs containing an anti-psychotic and an anti-depressant were counted only in the anti-psychotic FDC category. FDC formulations on the market with and without a record of CDSCO approval are termed respectively “approved” and “unapproved”. Data sources: PharmaTrac; CDSCO-published list of FDC approvals 1961–February 2013. Conversion rate: INR 1 = US$0.016. Small differences in totals arise from rounding. The 19 NSAID formulations launched on the market before 1 May 2002 gave rise to 1,895 NSAID branded products, of which 31% (n = 583) were from unapproved formulations. Of 844 products arising from the 105 formulations marketed after 1 May 2002, 69% (n = 582) were from unapproved formulations (Table 1). Among metformin FDCs, no products marketed before 1 May 2002 were from unapproved formulations, compared with 9% (n = 28) after 1 May 2002. For antidepressant/benzodiazepine FDCs and anti-psychotic FDCs, 87% and 100%, respectively, of products marketed before 1 May 2002 were from unapproved formulations, compared with 62% and 57% after 1 May 2002 (Table 1). FDC Sales: Sales Trends for 2007–2012 and Sales Volumes (2011–2012) Arising from Unapproved Formulations\nThe total oral drug market in each therapeutic area was composed of FDCs and SDFs (Table 1). Sales volumes of NSAIDs and metformin/anti-diabetes drugs were substantial compared with anti-depressants/benzodiazepines and anti-psychotics. During the 5 y examined, FDCs comprised increasing annual proportions of total sales volumes (Fig 2), and by 2011–2012 they accounted for over half of all NSAIDs and oral anti-diabetic drugs sold, one-third of anti-psychotic drugs, and almost one-fifth of anti-depressants/benzodiazepines (Table 1). 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001826.g002\nFig 2 FDCs as proportions of total annual oral drug sales volumes in each therapeutic area, November 2007–October 2012.\nMetformin FDCs are expressed as a percent of total oral diabetes drugs. Numerator and denominator data are included in S3 Table.  Overall, across the four therapeutic areas, approved and unapproved formulations contributed varying proportions of FDC sales volumes: almost all metformin FDC sales were from CDSCO-approved formulations, but formulations unapproved by the CDSCO accounted for over two-thirds of anti-depressant/benzodiazepine FDC sales (69%), almost half of anti-psychotic FDCs (43%), and more than a quarter of NSAID FDCs (28%) (Table 1). Sales values followed generally similar patterns. Fig 1 summarises the proportions of formulations and products on the market and sales volumes and value in 2011–2012 arising in each therapeutic area from unapproved formulations.\nFormulations marketed before 1 May 2002 accounted for most of the NSAID FDC sales volume (5,397.3 million tablets/capsules); 14% of this volume arose from unapproved formulations. In contrast, of the sales volume arising from formulations marketed after 1 May 2002 (1,743.8 million tablets/capsules), 74% was from unapproved formulations. Five metformin FDC formulations marketed after 2002 had no record of CDSCO approval, but their contribution to overall sales volume was low (0.4%). For anti-depressant/benzodiazepine and anti-psychotic FDCs, sales arising from formulations marketed before 1 May 2002 were comprised almost entirely of products arising from unapproved formulations; of sales arising from formulations marketed after 1 May 2002, however, 25%–29% were from unapproved formulations. Formulation Composition, CDSCO Approval, Sales Volumes, and Numbers of Branded Products Marketed NSAIDs\nFour CDSCO-approved formulations, each comprising a NSAID and paracetamol, accounted for 61% of total FDC sales volumes: ibuprofen (2,400 million tablets/capsules), diclofenac (797 million), aceclofenac (715 million), and nimesulide (558 million). Together, the four formulations gave rise to hundreds of branded products, of which some were new to the market during 2007–2012 and had rising sales and some were older and had declining sales (ibuprofen + paracetamol, 158 products; diclofenac + paracetamol, 298; aceclofenac + paracetamol, 327; nimesulide + paracetamol, 292) (S2 Table).\nThe remaining 30 CDSCO-approved formulations comprised 8% of sales volumes. Most frequently, these were NSAID combinations with muscle relaxants (chlorzoxazone, dicyclomine, drotaverine, thiocolchicoside, tizanidine, tolperisone) or proteolytic enzymes (serratiopeptidase, trypsin-chymotrypsin). There were also combinations with misoprostol, tranexamic acid, and sumatriptan (S2 Table). The marketing date preceded the CDSCO approval date for 23/34 approved formulations.\nNinety unapproved formulations accounted for 28% of sales volumes, and unspecified “other” formulations for 2.6%. The top-selling unapproved formulations were mefenamic acid + dicyclomine, 4.7% of sales; aceclofenac + paracetamol + serratiopeptidase, 4.4%; ibuprofen + paracetamol + caffeine, 2%; and diclofenac + paracetamol + chlorzoxazone, 2%. Other unapproved formulations included FDCs of NSAIDs with paracetamol plus a muscle relaxant, tramadol, dextropropoxyphene, anti-ulcer agent, anti-histamine, caffeine, another NSAID, or sumatriptan (S2 Table). Metformin\nCDSCO-approved formulations accounted for almost all sales by volume in 2011–2012 (total sales 4,558 million tablets/capsules) (Table 2). The marketing date preceded the CDSCO approval date for 11/20 approved formulations. The most popular FDCs were dual combinations with sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glipizide, gliclazide, glibenclamide) and a triple combination with glimepiride and pioglitazone (Table 2). These formulations gave rise to 536 branded products, most (n = 424, 79%) with sales recorded in 2011–2012. Metformin + glimepiride had 137 different products; metformin + gliclazide, 102; metformin + glimepiride + pioglitazone, 68; and metformin + pioglitazone, 61. Anti-depressants/benzodiazepines\nThree CDSCO-approved formulations combining a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with a benzodiazepine comprised 31.1% of FDC sales volumes (total sales 638.5 million tablets/capsules) in 2011–2012 (escitalopram + clonazepam, 26.3%; sertraline + alprazolam, 3.9%; paroxetine + clonazepam, 0.9%) (Table 3). The marketing date preceded the CDSCO approval date for 1/3 approved formulations (sertraline + alprazolam). Of 13 formulations unapproved by the CDSCO, seven were FDCs of two centrally acting drugs and three were benzodiazepine + propranolol FDCs (Table 3). Benzodiazepine with tricyclic antidepressant combinations accounted for 47.3% of sales. Among the most popular FDCs, dozens of branded products were available, most with sales recorded in 2011–2012 (Table 3). Anti-psychotics\nOf ten formulations on the market, three accounted for 56.6% (237.3 million tablets/capsules) of anti-psychotic sales in 2011–2012 (total sales 419.3 million tablets/capsules) (olanzapine + fluoxetine; chlordiazepoxide + trifluoperazine + trihexyphenidyl; flupenthixol + melitracen) (Table 4). CDSCO approval preceded the marketing date in all cases. The most popular was flupenthixol + melitracen (221.9 million tablets/capsules, 53% of sales volume). Seven formulations included trihexyphenidyl (benzhexol). FDC Formulations with State Licenses but Not Approved by the CDSCO\nThe list of 294 FDCs with state licenses but unapproved by the CDSCO included 72 NSAID FDC formulations, of which 33 were on the market; 15 anti-depressant/benzodiazepine FDC formulations, with five on the market; and one metformin formulation not marketed [14]. No anti-psychotic formulations were listed. FDCs Including Drugs Banned, Restricted, or Never Approved Internationally\nMultiple formulations, most without CDSCO approval, included drugs banned, restricted, or never approved internationally owing to adverse effects (Table 5) [23–29]. Sales volumes were generally high. None of these drugs had MHRA (UK) or FDA (US) approval. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001826.t005\nTable 5 Drugs withdrawn or restricted internationally that were included in FDC formulations marketed in India.

Many NSAID FDC formulations available in India (both approved and unapproved) included muscle relaxants or proteolytic enzymes, of which several were approved as SDFs in the UK and/or US but none were components of NSAID FDCs in either country (Table 6). FDCs including two NSAIDs (diclofenac + nimesulide, mefenamic acid + ibuprofen) were not approved in the UK or the US. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001826.t006\nTable 6 Muscle relaxants and proteolytic enzymes included in NSAID FDC formulations marketed in India.

N, no; Y, yes. In quantifying the use of FDCs in four different therapeutic areas and determining the relative contributions of CDSCO-approved and-unapproved FDCs, this study confirms the concerns of the 59th Report about FDC regulation in India. In three of the four areas examined, there were more unapproved formulations on the market than approved formulations. In turn these had given rise to hundreds—and in the case of NSAIDs, thousands—of branded products. Many millions of doses were sold of FDCs that included drugs restricted, banned, or never approved in other countries owing to their association with serious adverse events including fatality.Multiple formulations of the FDCs studied were marketed without any record of CDSCO approval, supporting the concern that “many FDCs in the market have not been tested for efficacy and safety” (Section 9.2 of [6]). This occurred despite the legal need since 1961 for a new drug to have been approved before manufacture, including an FDC meeting the applicable legal test (see Box 1). Unexplained “ambiguity” before 1 May 2002 regarding the licensing powers of state drug authorities is noted in the 59th Report as a possible contributor (Section 9.2 of [6]). In our analysis of the data in four therapeutic areas, we found no notable differences in the overall proportion of centrally approved formulations after 1 May 2002 compared with before. In our detailed analysis of the national rules (S1 Text), we found no ambiguity relating to the question of whether an FDC needed central approval prior to manufacture. Clearly, however, the legal test until 1988 needed to be interpreted in order to determine its application to FDCs, and practice appears to have varied, as presumably approval was sought for some FDCs but not for others. Numerous FDCs were marketed before the CDSCO approval date, suggesting that in some cases state licenses permitting manufacturing and sale were obtained first and approval sought retrospectively. However, state drug authority records to confirm this were unavailable.NSAIDs are among the most widely used drugs internationally. Almost 12 billion NSAID tablets/capsules were sold in India in 2011–2012; NSAID FDCs comprised almost two-thirds of these, of which 28% were unapproved formulations. Over 12% of NSAID FDC sales volumes included drugs that have been withdrawn from international markets or have had their use restricted, for example, dextropropoxyphene, metamizole, melitracen, nimesulide, and thiocolchicoside, owing to risks including death in overdose, liver failure, and genetic effects [23–29]. FDCs including two NSAIDs are highly undesirable due to associated gastrointestinal risks [12]. In contrast to NSAIDs, most metformin FDC formulations had CDSCO approval and accounted for practically all FDCs used and over half of total oral anti-diabetic drug sales volumes. Among both groups of CNS drugs examined, unapproved formulations comprised substantial FDC sales volumes: 69% of antidepressant/benzodiazepine FDCs and 43% of anti-psychotic FDCs. Sales volumes of these FDCs were lower than those of NSAID and metformin FDCs, but the combinations were commonly hazardous. Indeed, some anti-psychotic FDCs were potentially lethal. For example, the combination chlorpromazine + trifluoperazine + trihexyphenidyl contains two phenothiazine anti-psychotics independently associated with major CNS toxicity and with cardiotoxicity including sudden death, risks also associated with FDCs containing thioridazine [10,11,29]. Tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotic medicines are independently associated with increased risk of falls, especially among older patients [30]. Nevertheless, FDCs comprising these sedating classes in single formulations were sold in considerable volumes.Since 2001, the CDSCO is obliged to be satisfied as to the safety and effectiveness of products approved. The grounds for approval are not published, but the regulator acknowledges having approved some new drugs without clinical data (Section 7 of [6]) [31,32]. Many formulations being sold without approval contravene FDC development guidance on basic pharmacological parameters [8,33]. Pharmacovigilance in India is at an early stage and adverse event reporting rates are very low, so the absence of adverse event reports offers no reassurance of the safety of such formulations (Sections 8 and 12 of [6]) [34–36]. Overall, among the four therapeutic areas examined, most of the FDC formulations available in India were unavailable in either the UK or the US.The study has limitations. We relied on publicly available records for central approvals and commercial sales records to determine the formulations marketed, the market launch dates, and the sales volumes. These sources were not compiled in order to support research, and they cannot be independently verified. Nevertheless, they are nationwide datasets that permit informative examination of data relevant to complaints about regulation and use in India of FDCs. The sales data reflect mainly private out-of-pocket prescription spending. Sales through hospitals and dispensing doctors may include government-subsidised drugs, but we could not confirm this. In comparing the numbers of formulations on the market in India in each therapeutic area with those in the UK and US, it is possible that some formulations listed in PharmaTrac as “other” were overlooked and not identified by us owing to small volumes sold. We cross-checked FDC formulations approved in the UK and US but not found in PharmaTrac with the MIMS India listings and found two additional metformin FDCs available in India (with linagliptin and saxagliptin) [37]. We found no additional NSAID or psychotropic FDCs listed in MIMS India. Other than the list of 294 banned FDCs, we did not have information on manufacturing/distribution licences granted by state drug authorities. The list of banned FDCs, however, was consistent with the 59th Report’s claim that some FDCs were licensed by states without prior CDSCO approval. Notwithstanding the limitations of the sales data and the absence of systematic central regulatory and state licensing records, this study substantiates the complaints of the 59th Report in demonstrating that regulatory problems in India extend well beyond widely publicised concerns about manufacturing standards.\nFactors Potentially Contributing to the Large Numbers of FDCs\nIn the four therapeutic areas examined, most of the FDC formulations available in India were unavailable in the UK and US. FDCs were sold in large volumes. They dominated oral NSAID and diabetes drug sales and comprised substantial sales proportions in the CNS areas. In contrast, National Health Service data for publicly subsidised prescribed medicines that were dispensed in England show that metformin FDCs accounted for <5% of oral diabetes drug use in 2012 [38]. There was no FDC dispensing recorded in the other therapeutic areas [38].\nProblematic production and use in India of FDCs will not be rectified without addressing the contributing causes. A commonly cited driver, though not discussed in the 59th Report, is manufacturers’ desire to avoid government price controls imposed on drugs included on the National List of Essential Medicines of India [39]. Price control has been evaded by including these drugs in FDC formulations [39,40] (though amendments in the 2013 National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy may prevent this) [41]. However, price control could also be evaded by manufacturing SDFs of different strength to those on the National List of Essential Medicines of India [39], and the evasion argument does not explain why prescribers prefer FDCs. Neither does it explain the large numbers of FDC products on the market.\nAttempts been made to improve India’s drug regulatory situation following the 59th Report. The Drugs Controller General (India) (DCG[I]) requested that states ask manufacturers to prove the safety and efficacy of their FDCs licensed without central approval within a period of 18 mo (January 2013) [42], policy guidelines for approval of FDCs were published (June 2013) [43], and the Chaudhury committee made recommendations on new drugs, clinical trials, and banning of drugs (July 2013) [44]. Legislative underpinning for the 18-mo safety and efficacy review, however, was lacking, and following industry lobbying, the DCG(I) excluded from it FDCs licensed before 21 September 1988 (June 2014) [45]. The president of Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association subsequently made “an earnest appeal” to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to “maintain status quo” for FDCs licensed by states or approved by DCG(I) up to 30 September 2012 [46].\nIn our view, significant factors contributing to the large number of FDCs on the market include structural problems with provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, stemming partly from the aged Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and amendments to the rules (2005) [47]. These include: the blurring over time of the initial clarity of responsibility between central government (responsible for imported drugs) and the states (responsible for manufacture, distribution, and sale); the absence of a duty on the regulator in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, to be satisfied of a new drug’s safety and effectiveness; the apparently random interchangeability of the different concepts of efficacy and effectiveness; the unclear and contradictory scope of the FDCs that are covered by the 1988 rules, and their inconsistency with WHO guidelines [8]; and the downgrading in 2005 of data submission requirements [40]. The Drugs and Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill introduced in Parliament in 2013 and the proposed version put out for 12 d of consultation by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 31 December 2014 are not aimed at these issues [48,49]. Recommendations\nFirst, there should be an immediate ban on sales and manufacturing of FDCs not approved by the CDSCO. Withdrawal from the market should be staged, prioritising FDCs that include drugs banned or unapproved internationally and potentially most likely to harm patients. Prescribers need to review the needs of patients taking these FDCs, taper off the drugs, and substitute appropriate alternatives prescribed as SDFs with monitoring of benefit/need. Approved FDC formulations containing drugs that have been withdrawn or restricted by other regulators should be reviewed with the intention of applying similar restrictions in India unless a strong evidence base dictates otherwise. All other approved FDCs should be reviewed for continuing approval. In all cases, the evidence and rationale for decisions need to be made freely available. This means that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should exercise its statutory powers to prohibit the import, manufacture, distribution, and sale of FDCs under Section 10A or 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1945 [15], in line with any CDSCO recommendations or, in the event of it not doing so, should explain and publish its reasoning.\nSecond, transparency and accountability of regulatory decisions must be improved. Complete details of approvals, including the clinical evidence base, need to be made available by the CDSCO for public scrutiny. Support needs to be provided to the CDSCO in terms of planning, information systems, and skilled personnel in order to achieve this.\nThird, the CDSCO and the state authorities should establish transparent and public procedures for ensuring that notice of all new drug approvals given by the CDSCO is immediately given to each state licensing authority, and vice versa for all manufacturing, distribution, and sale licences granted by each state. Such notices should be published on the websites of the CDSCO and the state licensing authorities.\nFinally, following the DCG(I)’s worrying restriction of the FDC safety and efficacy review, and the 2014 parliamentary elections, the new Parliament should monitor closely the activities of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the CDSCO. If the proposed Drugs and Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill, 2015, reaches Parliament [49], opportunity exists for legislators to propose amendments on safety, effectiveness, rationality, need, and, perhaps most importantly, transparent regulation. Requiring a review of the safety and effectiveness of all currently available FDCs, not unlike the legally required review mandated by the US Congress in 1962, rather than the administrative review that has been shown to be susceptible to industry lobbying, makes eminent sense [50]."],"prob":["drug, medicin, prescrib, use, medic, prescript, adher"],"frex":["prescrib, prescript, adr, pharmaci, pharmacist, sale, generic"],"lift":["deprescrib, unapprov, brand-nam, pharmacist’, wholesal, eml, co-prescrib"],"score":["drug, prescript, prescrib, medicin, pharmacist, adr, price"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["countri, physician, hospit, cost, care, health, medic"],"children":[{"name":["cost, cost-effect, qali, countri, avert, icer, econom"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[25],"thought_1":["Background: With the commitment of the national government to provide universal healthcare at cheap and affordable prices in India, public healthcare services are being strengthened in India. However, there is dearth of cost data for provision of health services through public system like primary & community health centres. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap in evidence by assessing the total annual and per capita cost of delivering the package of health services at PHC and CHC level. Secondly, we determined the per capita cost of delivering specific health services like cost per antenatal care visit, per institutional delivery, per outpatient consultation, per bed-day hospitalization etc. Methods: We undertook economic costing of fourteen public health facilities (seven PHCs and CHCs each) in three North-Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. Bottom-up costing method was adopted for collection of data on all resources spent on delivery of health services in selected health facilities. Analysis was undertaken using a health system perspective. The joint costs like human resource, capital, and equipment were apportioned as per the time value spent on a particular service. Capital costs were discounted and annualized over the estimated life of the item. Mean annual costs and unit costs were estimated along with their 95% confidence intervals using bootstrap methodology. Results: The overall annual cost of delivering services through public sector primary and community health facilities in three states of north India were INR 8.8 million (95% CI: 7,365,630–10,294,065) and INR 26.9 million (95% CI: 22,225,159.3–32,290,099.6), respectively. Human resources accounted for more than 50% of the overall costs at both the level of PHCs and CHCs. Per capita per year costs for provision of complete package of preventive, curative and promotive services at PHC and CHC were INR 170.8 (95% CI: 131.6–208.3) and INR162.1 (95% CI: 112–219.1), respectively. Conclusion: The study estimates can be used for financial planning of scaling up of similar health services in the urban areas under the aegis of National Health Mission. The estimates would be also useful in undertaking equity analysis and full economic evaluations of the health systems."],"thought_2":["Background: Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) persist in many low- and middle-income countries. To date, the cost-effectiveness of population-based, combined primary and secondary prevention strategies has not been assessed. In the Pinar del Rio province of Cuba, a comprehensive ARF/RHD control program was undertaken over 1986 – 1996. The present study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of this Cuban program. Methods and Findings: We developed a decision tree model based on the natural history of ARF/RHD, comparing the costs and effectiveness of the 10-year Cuban program to a “do nothing” approach. Our population of interest was the cohort of children aged 5 – 24 years resident in Pinar del Rio in 1986. We assessed costs and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon, and we took the healthcare system perspective on costs but did not apply a discount rate. We used epidemiologic, clinical, and direct medical cost inputs that were previously collected for publications on the Cuban program. We estimated health gains as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted using standard approaches developed for the Global Burden of Disease studies. Cost-effectiveness acceptability thresholds were defined by one and three times per capita gross domestic product per DALY averted. We also conducted an uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulations and several scenario analyses exploring the impact of alternative assumptions about the program’s effects and costs. We found that, compared to doing nothing, the Cuban program averted 5051 DALYs (1844 per 100,000 school-aged children) and saved $7,848,590 (2010 USD) despite a total program cost of $202,890 over 10 years. In the scenario analyses, the program remained cost saving when a lower level of effectiveness and a reduction in averted years of life lost were assumed. In a worst-case scenario including 20-fold higher costs, the program still had a 100% of being cost-effective and an 85% chance of being cost saving. Conclusions: A 10-year program to control ARF/RHD in Pinar del Rio, Cuba dramatically reduced morbidity and premature mortality in children and young adults and was cost saving. The results of our analysis were robust to higher program costs and more conservative assumptions about the program’s effectiveness. It is possible that the program’s effectiveness resulted from synergies between primary and secondary prevention strategies. The findings of this study have implications for non-communicable disease policymaking in other resource-limited settings."],"prob":["cost, countri, health, per, estim, year, nation"],"frex":["cost, cost-effect, qali, countri, avert, icer, econom"],"lift":["oop, life-year, yld, dali, qali, icer, willingness-to-pay"],"score":["cost, countri, health, qali, cost-effect, polici, nation"],"proportion":["0.02"]},{"name":["physician, ed, nurs, inpati, care, outpati, specialist"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[75],"thought_1":["Advanced Radiology Utilization in a Tertiary Care Emergency Department from 2001 to 2010"],"thought_2":["Emergency Department Overcrowding and Ambulance Turnaround Time"],"prob":["care, medic, hospit, physician, health, servic, visit"],"frex":["physician, ed, nurs, inpati, care, outpati, specialist"],"lift":["namc, pcps, etat, nhamc, acgm, telemedicin, safety-net"],"score":["physician, hospit, care, servic, visit, nurs, ed"],"proportion":["0.02"]}],"topic_no":[25,75]},{"name":["analysi, use, test, inform, data, studi, includ"],"children":[{"name":["code, file, databas, date, regist, dataset, data"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[29],"thought_1":["We used record linkage to create a data repository of health information of persons who were federally incarcerated in Ontario and Canada.

Given the locally piece-wise constant nature of PET images, we introduce the total variation (TV) based reconstruction schemes. More specifically, we formulate the 2D PET reconstruction problem as an optimization problem, whose objective function consists of TV norm of the reconstructed image and the data fidelity term measuring the consistency between the reconstructed image and sinogram. To solve the resulting minimization problem, we apply an efficient methods called the Bregman operator splitting algorithm with variable step size (BOSVS). Experiments based on Monte Carlo simulated data and real data are conducted as validations.

Then we introduce our original formalism which ensures, using overlapping patches, a smooth transition at the patches borders, and finally we apply this formalism to CT reconstruction. In order to make clearer the text we added the following sentences in the introduction of the method: In this approach an iterative loop between the sinogram space and the real space is used. A fidelity term is imposed in the sinogram space while a sparsity inducing term is introduced in the real space.\nWe denote by  the indicator function of patch p, which is equal to 1 over the patch support (typically an m*m square) and is zero otherwhere. For non-overlapping patches, covering the whole domain, we have:(1)where  denotes the pixel position and can be thought as a two-dimensional vector. We are looking for the ideal solution  that we express by the vector, , of its coefficients in the basis of patch functions:(2)where the set  is an over-complete basis of functions over the patch support;  is the closest to the origin corner of the patch , and  is the component  of vector  which multiplies the basis function  in the patch . The denoising problem, given an image , consists in finding the minimum of a functional  which is sum of two terms. The term  links the solution to the the data . The other term, , contains the a-priori knowledge about the solution. This way of breaking the functional in two terms has his roots in the Bayesian theorem. From a probabilistic point of view the denoising problem consists in finding, given a noisy image  of an object, the most probable object  that can generate that image. We represent the object  through the patches coefficients . The Bayes theorem, applied to denoising, states that the conditional probability of  being the exact object given a measurement , is the product of the probability of  being the measure given the exact solution  times the a-priori probability of .\nAssuming gaussian noise, the conditional probability of  being the measure given the exact solution  is , where  is expressed through the patches coefficients  by equation 2. The exact a-priori probability of  is unknown but we approximate it as . This function expresses our a-priori knowledge that a non sparse solution having a high value of the  penalization term  (which is a sparsity-inducing term [6]) has low probability. The most probable solution  is obtained by finding the  minimum:(3)\nThe solution can be obtained by using the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm [3] (ISTA):(4)where  is the shrinkage operator defined as(5)and  is a positive number lesser than the inverse of the Lipschitz condition number :(6)\nThe Lipschitz number L is such that:(7)\nThe ISTA algorithm can be accelerated by the Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding [7](FISTA) method.\nIn its non-overlapping version, the image denoising with patches is able to detect features that are within the field of the patch: if a line crosses the central region of a patch, it will be detected if the basis of functions has been trained to detect such lines. But in the situation where a line intersects only one point in a corner of the patch square, the signal of this point is indistinguishable from that of a noisy point, no matter the dictionary training.\nFor this reason the patches denoising technique is often used with overlapping patches using post-process averaging [8]. In this case the minimization problem is solved for each patch separately first, and then the averaging is performed in the overlapped regions.\nIn this study we do not follow this procedure but we add an overlap term into the objective function. We choose a system of patches which covers the whole domain, and we allow for overlapping. In our implementation of the algorithm the set of all patches is formed by a set of non-overlapping m*m square patches covering the image plus the translated copies that we obtain by  translational vectors, where  are positive integers,  is a constant step size selected by the user and .\nIn the case of overlapping patches the sum of all indicator functions is greater or equal to one:(8)\nWe define the core indicator functions , which indicate the core of the patches, and make a non-overlapping covering:(9)\nFor our implementation, when the translational step size  is equal to one, the core region is a pixel at the center of the patch. The core region gets larger when the step size increases.\nFor a given point ,  indicates which patch  has its center  closest to point :(10)\nThe solution  is composed as a function of  using the central part of the patches as indicated by the functions :(11)\nNow we introduce the  operator which is the projection operator, for tomography reconstruction, and is the identity for image denoising. The functional  whose minimum gives the optimal solution is written, for both applications, as:(12)where the  factor weights a similarity-inducing term which pushes all the overlapping patches touching a point , towards the value  of the global solution  in that point. For future reference we call  the fidelity term. The factor  has also the role of a regularisation parameter: as an example we consider the case where the set of overlapping patches is generated with a translational step . In this case the core indicator function has a 1*1 pixel domain and, without the  term, we could get a perfect fit, for an arbitrary image, by using for each patch an arbitrary component chosen randomly amongst those which are not zero at the core pixel. The solution is found with the FISTA method, using the gradient of  which is easily written as:(13)where  is the adjoint operator of P, called back-projection operator in the case of tomography, which is again the identity for image denoising.

Their objective function is(14)\nXu et al. used the non-convex OMP procedure for minimisation of the functional. In this paper we will also compare their functional to our, using for both functionals the FISTA optimization. Total Variation penalisation\nIn the total variation (TV) method [5] one minimises a convex functional given by the sum of the fidelity term  and of a gradient-sparsity inducing term , where  is a regularisation parameter and  gives the isotropic total variation of the image : (15) Equally Sloped Tomography\nEqually Sloped Tomography (EST) is a Fourier-based iterative reconstruction method that iterates back and forth between real and Fourier space, utilizing an algebraically exact Pseudo-Polar fast Fourier transform [4], [9]. Measured projections (in this case obtained by the radon transform) are inserted into the Fourier space thanks to the fractional Fourier transform (FrFFT). Then the Pseudo-Polar Fast Fourier transform (PPFFT) and its adjoint are utilized to transform the images back and forth between Fourier and object space. During each iteration, physical constraints including sample boundary and the positivity of the coefficient are enforced in real space, while the measured data are applied in the Fourier space. The algorithm, monitored by an error metric, is guided towards the minimum that is consistent with the experimental data. To prevent any human intervention, the algorithm is automatically terminated when no further improvement can be made. In this case the number of iterations was 50 for a good convergence of the algorithm using 80 projections.\nThe EST algorithm has proved to allow a drastic reduction of the number of projections for conventional CT [9] and phase contrast imaging [4]. Fahimian et al. [9] demonstrated that the image quality and contrast obtained with EST is comparable with other iterative reconstruction schemes such as TV minimization or expected minimization statistical reconstruction with a faster convergence."],"prob":["use, method, algorithm, simul, can, featur, set"],"frex":["simul, algorithm, nois, spatial, iter, comput, rf"],"lift":["gpu, down-sampl, detrend, solver, hyperplan, entropi, capacitor"],"score":["simul, algorithm, spatial, signal, nois, accuraci, train"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[12,34]},{"name":["x, y, m, f, δ, j, r"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[68],"thought_1":["In vitro antioxidant activity assays 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH)radical scavenging activity\nDetermination of the free radical scavenging activity of the synthesized compounds was performed as reported [18]. A solution of 195 μl of 100 μM DPPH reagent in 96% ethanol was added to an ethanolic solution (5 μl) of the synthesized compound and mixed in a 96-well plate. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature and the absorption intensity was measured at intervals of 20 minutes for 3 hours at 515 nm. The slope was calculated from a graph of OD 515 nm vs. time (min). The percentage inhibition of the DPPH radical was calculated according to the following formula: DPPHradicalscavenged(%)=[(ODblank−ODsample)/ODblank]×100 Where,\nOD blank is the absorbance of the control DPPH solution, OD sample is the tested compound absorbance.\nIC50 (compound concentration required to reduce the absorbance of the DPPH control solution by 50%) was then calculated. Ferric ion reducing power (FRAP) assay\nThe reducing capacities of the prepared compounds were measured by the method of Benzie and Strain with a modification [19]. First, 10 ml of acetate buffer (300 mM) was adjusted to pH 3.6 by mixing with 3.1 g CH3COONa∙3H2O and 16 ml glacial acetic acid. Next, a 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine TPTZ solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mM TPTZ in 40 mM HCl. Then, 1 ml of the2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine)TPTZ solution was mixed with the FRAP solution, and 1 ml of ferric chloride hexahydrate (20 mM) in distilled water. The FRAP solution was warmed to 37°C, the tested compound was added to it, and the mixture was left to react in the dark. The absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 593 nm. The results were expressed in μM ferrous/g dry mass and compared with the reference compounds. Gastric ulcer study Omeprazole\nIn this study, omeprazole was used as the reference anti-ulcer drug, and was obtained from the University Malaya Medical Centre Pharmacy. The drug was dissolved in 10% Tween 20 and administered orally to the rats in concentrations of 20 mg/kg body weight (5 ml/kg) [20]. Ethics statement\nThis study was carried out according to the criteria outlined in the “Guide for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals” prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the national Institute of health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Malaya (UM IACUC) with Ethic Numbers: PM/07/05/2012/MAA (a) (R) and PM/28/09/2012/MAA (R). All surgery was performed under xylazin and ketamine anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Acute toxicity test and experimental animals\nAdult healthy female Sprague Dawley rats (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from the Animal House Experimental Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. The rats weighed between 180–200 g. The rats were given standard rat pellets and tap water. The acute toxic study was used to determine a safe dose for synthesized compound. This study was carried out by the \"fixed dose\" method of OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) Guideline No.420 [21]. The fixed dose method with the starting dose of 500 mg/kg body weight was adopted. The rats were fasted overnight and next day the compound (suspended in 10% tween 80 solutions) was administered orally at a dose level 500 mg/kg. Then the rats were observed continuously for 3 hours for general behavioral, neurological, and autonomic profiles and then every 30 minutes for next 3 hours and finally for mortality after 24 hours till 14 days [22] and throughout this period of observation, no cases of death among the rats were occurred. After overnight fasting, the animals were sacrificed on the day 15; the rats were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg ketamin mixed with xylazine 5 mg/kg. The abdomen and thoracic cavities were opened by a mid-ventral abdominal incision on each animal. The liver and kidney were carefully observed for any gross pathology. Histology and serum biochemical parameters were determined [23, 24].Through the jugular vein, blood was withdrawn and collected into the plain tube with activated gel for determination of the liver and kidney function tests by the blood analysis machine at the Clinical Diagnosis Laboratory of Medical Centre (CDL) in University Malaya Hospital. Experimental animals for gastric ulcer\nHealthy Sprague Dawley rats of 6–8 weeks old and weighing (200–225 g) were obtained from the Experimental Animal House, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. The rats were divided randomly into 5 groups of 6 rats each. Each rat was placed individually in a separate cage (one rat per cage) with wide-mesh wire bottoms to prevent coprophagia during the experiment. The animals were fed on standard pellets and tap water. Gastric ulcer-induction by ethanol\nThe rats were fasted for 24 hours before the experiment but were allowed free access to drinking water up till 2 hours before the experiment [25]. Gastric ulcer was induced by orogastric intubation of absolute ethanol (5 ml/kg) [20]. Ulcer control groups were orally administered vehicle (10%Tween 20, 5ml/kg). The reference group received oral doses of 20 mg/kg omeprazole in 10%Tween 20 (5 ml/kg) as positive control. Experimental groups were orally administered of compound 1in 10%Tween 20 (5 ml/kg) at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. One hour after this pretreatment, all groups of rats were administered orally with absolute ethanol (5 ml/kg) in order to induce gastric ulcers. The rats were euthanized 60 minutes later [26], by means of overdose of xylazin and ketamine anesthesia and their stomachs were immediately excised, washed and kept in containers of normal saline. Gross pathological evaluation of acute gastric ulcer\nThe gastric mucosa of each rat was macroscopically examined for any elongated band of haemorrhagic lesion. The ulcer area of each band (length and width) were measured by a planimeter (10 × 10 mm2 = ulcer area) under dissecting microscope (1.8x). The ulcerated area was measured by counting the number of small squares, 2 mm × 2 mm, covering each ulcer band. The sum of the ulcer areas for each stomach was applied in the calculation of the ulcer area (UA) where in the sum of small squares × 4 × 1.8 = UA (mm2). The inhibition percentage (I %) was calculated by the following formula [12, 27]: (I%)=[(UAcontrol–UAtreated)÷UAcontrol]×100 Histopathological evaluation of acute gastric ulcer\nSpecimens of the gastric walls for all the animal groups were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution, processed by light microscopy by paraffin slice technique. Sections with 5μm thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stain for histological evaluation [27]. Additionally, a special stain Periodic Acid Schiff Base (PAS) was used to evaluate mucus production, following the manufacture instruction (Sigma Periodic Acid-Schiff -PAS Kit). For further analysis, immunohistochemistry stain using Dako ARK™ was performed to detect the localization of HSP-70 and Bax proteins. Both proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., California, USA. Mucus content measurement\nThe stomach production of mucus was measured in each rat that was subjected to absolute ethanol-induced gastric lesions. The gastric mucosa of each rat was obtained by gentle scraping the mucosa with a glass slide and the collected mucus were weighed by using a precision electronic balance[28]. Gastric juice (pH) measurement\nHydrogen ion concentration for the samples of gastric contents was measured by pH metric titration with 0.1 N NaOH solutions using digital pH meter [27, 29]. Statistical analysis\nAll values were reported as mean ± S.E.M. The statistical significance of differences between groups was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc analysis by the prism statistical package. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant. Experimental\nAll chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and purchased from Aldrich and Merck. Melting points were determined using a MEL-TEMP II apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded from 4000–400 cm-1 using a Perkin Elmer 400 Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded on a BRUKER-AVN III 400 MHz instrument using DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on TSQ7000 for HREI/MS.

Chemistry\nReagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. The reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography, which was performed on aluminum sheets pre-coated with silica gel 60 (HF-254, Merck) to a thickness of 0.25 mm. The chromatograms were viewed under ultraviolet light (254–265 nm). For column chromatography Merck silica gel (70–230 mesh) was used. 1H NMR spectra were determined in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide using a Bruker DPX-200 at 200 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were determined in this spectrometer at 50 MHz, employing the same solvent. Chemical shifts are given in parts per million (δ) from tretramethylsilane as internal standard, and coupling constant values (J) are given in Hertz (Hz). Signal multiplicities are represented by: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quadruplet), m (multiplet) and br (broad signal). Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained with a FTLA 2000–100 spectrophotometer using potassium bromide plates.\nMelting points of final products were determined with a Quimis 340 apparatus and are uncorrected. The purity of compounds were determined by HPLC (>95%) using the Shimadzu – LC20AD apparatus, a Kromasil 100-5C18 (4,6 mm×250 mm) column and the SPD-M20A detector (Diode Array) at 254 nm for quantification of analyte in a 1 mL/min constant flux. The injector was programmed to inject a volume of 20 -µL. The mobile phases used were: CH3CN∶H2O 1∶1; 6∶4 and 7∶3.\nUltraviolet spectroscopy was performed using Femto spectrophotometer. The wavelength used in solubility assay was determined by the -λ max characteristic of each compound. Spectra were analyzed in Femtoscan software. Mass spectrometry was obtained by positive ionization at Bruker AmaZon SL and data analyzed in Compass 1.3.SR2 software. General Procedure for the preparation of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzohydrazide (8)\nTo a solution of methyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (7) (2.00 g, 8.84 mmol) in absolute methanol (26 mL), 8.56 mL (176.8 mmol) of hydrazine hydrate 80% was added. The reaction mixture was kept under reflux for 5 hours, when TLC indicated the end of the reaction. Then, the media was poured into ice and the resulting precipitate was filtered out affording the 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzohydrazide in 88% yield, as a white solid, m.p. 166–168°C. The melting point, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR data are in agreement with previous reports [29]. I.R. (KBr) (cm−1): 3392, 3335, 3294, 3196 ν sim. and νassim.

X-ray Crystallography\nA colorless prismatic single crystal of the compound LASSBio-1586, suitable for x-ray study, was obtained by slow evaporation of a solution of methanol-dimethylformamide (2∶1) at room temperature 295(2) K. Data collection was performed using the Kappa Apex II Duo diffractometer operating with Cu-Kα radiation at 100 K. 8336 data points were collected of what 2687 are symmetry independent (Rint = 0.044). The molecule crystallizes in the Pca21 space group, having Z = 4. Structure solution was obtained using Direct Methods implemented in SHELXS [36] and the model refinement was performed with full matrix least squares on F2 using SHELXL [36], with final residuals R1 = 0.037, wR2 = 0.105 for 2461 observed data with I>2σ(I), and R1 = 0.046, wR2 = 0.111 for all data. The data completeness allowed for a qualitative decision of the chirality, however because only low weight atoms are present, the Flack parameter has a relatively large standard deviation, being 0.04(19). The crystal packing is stabilized by an intermolecular hydrogen bond of type N1–H1…O1i, building a linear chain though (100). Hydrogen bond geometry is given in Table 6.

Copies of the data can be obtained, free of charge, on application to CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK [fax: C44 1223 336033 or e-mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk]. Solubility Assay\nThe solubility assay was performed considering the absorptivity of compounds in ultraviolet spectroscopy as described by Schneider and coworkers [38]. The assay wavelength was determined by the λ max characteristic of each compound.\nSaturated aqueous solutions were prepared (0.01 mg/mL) and were kept under stirring for 2 hours at 37°C. The supernatant was filtered in 0,45 µm filters and transferred to a quartz cuvette (10 mm) to spectra acquisition.\nSolubility was determined by linear regression using as graph plots, solutions prepared by dilutions of the original solution in methanol. The data were obtained in triplicates and the mean values were used to the graph plots. The correlation coefficient (R2) values were between 0.9972 and 0.9999. In Vitro Antiproliferative Assay\nCompounds (0.009–5 µg/mL) were tested for cytotoxic activity against selected cancer cell lines: SF-295 (glioblastoma), HCT-8 (colon), MDAMB-435 (melanoma), HL60 (leukemia), PC3M (prostate cancer), OVCAR-8 (ovaries adenocarcinoma) and NCI-H258M (pulmonary bronchio-alveolar carcinoma). All cell lines were kindly obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA).Tumor cell proliferation was quantified through the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma Aldrich)) to a purple formazan product and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter) [21]. Tubulin Polymerization Assay\nThe tubulin polymerization assay was performed by CEREP®, as described by Bonne and co-workers [39]. Hollow Fiber Assay\nA total of 26 female BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice aging 6–8 weeks were obtained from the animal facilities of State University of São Paulo (USP), Faculty of Medicine, São Paulo (SP), Brazil. They were kept in well-ventilated and sterile cages (Alesco, São Paulo) under standard conditions of light (12 h with alternative day and night cycles) and temperature (22±1°C) and were housed with access to commercial sterile rodent stock diet (Nutrilabor, São Paulo, Brazil) and water ad libitum. As previously mentioned procedures are in accordance with guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia [40] and with national and international standard on the care and use of experimental laboratory animals [41] and were approved by the local Ethical Committee on Animal Research (Process No. 102/2007). Cell Culture\nCell culture of SF-295 (glioblastoma) and HCT-116 (colon carcinoma) was performed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, at 37°C with 5% CO2. HF Preparation, Surgery Deployment and Determination of the Antiproliferative Capacity\nPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) HFs with a 1-mm internal diameter and a molecular weight cutoff point of 500 kDa were used (Spectrum Laboratories, Houston, TX). The fibers were cut into pieces 12–15 cm long, washed 2× with sterile distilled water and kept in sterile conditions.\nBefore use, under sterile conditions, the fibers were incubated in complete RPMI with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) overnight (packaging time). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay. Then, a cell suspension of 7.0×106 cell/mL at 4°C was injected into the fiber, with the ends thereof immediately heat-sealed. The fibers were cut into 2 cm each, transferred to petri plates and incubated in complete RPMI medium for 24 h prior to implantation in mice. Each cell was injected into one fiber of a different color (HCT-116, yellow fibers; SF-295, blue fibers).\nMice were anaesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) - xylazine (4.5 mg/kg) (Sigma Aldrich). Groups were divided into: a) Negative control (DMSO 5%, n = 6); b) Positive control (5-Flouoruracil, 5-FU, 25 mg/kg/day, n = 7) (Sigma Aldrich); c) LASSBio-1586 (5b; 25 mg/kg/day, n = 7); d) LASSBio-1586 (5b; 50 mg/kg/day, n = 6). A small incision in the neck was incised to permit subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of the fibers in the dorsal part of the animal. Each animal received 2 fibers at s.c. site. All incisions were sealed with a surgical stapler. The test compounds were administered intraperitoneally during 4 consecutive days. On day 5, fibers were removed to quantify the antiproliferative capacity as described above. In Vivo Antiproliferative Assay\nTumor cell proliferation was quantified through the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma Aldrich) to a purple formazan product [21]. For this purpose, the fibers removed from animals were incubated with MTT 1 mg/mL in 6-well plates during 4 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The MTT solution was aspirated; fibers were washed with saline solution containing protamine sulphate 2.5% and incubated in protamine solution overnight at 4°C. Fibers were transferred to 24 well plates, cut into 2 or 3 pieces and put to dry. The formazan was dissolved in 500 mL of DMSO, aliquots (150 uL) were transferred to 96 well plates and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). Statistical Analysis\nIn order to determine differences between groups, data (mean ± S.E.M) were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student Newman-Keuls test (P<0.05). Molecular Modeling\nCompounds were constructed and submitted to a conformational analysis by molecular mechanics (MMFF method) with the Spartan 8.0 software (Wavefunction Inc.; Licence number: DQAIR/HASPUSB). The most stable conformer of each structure was reoptimized with the AM1 semiempirical molecular orbital method [42] and saved as mol2 files for docking studies into the colchicine binding site of the β-tubulin crystallographic structure available in the Protein Data Bank with code 1sa0. This structure was chosen because of the β-tubulin conformation induced by the co-crystallized colchicine, which prevents curved β-tubulin from adopting a straight structure, inhibiting assembly. Docking studies were implemented with the GOLD 5.0.1 program (CCDC), which employs a genetic algorithm for docking flexible ligands into protein binding sites and ranks the resulting poses according to their scores determined by available scoring functions. Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein structure according to the tautomeric and ionized states inferred by the program. The colchicine structure was removed for the docking studies, which were performed with the ChemScore scoring function, which contains specific energy terms for hydrogen bonding and lipophilic interactions [43], [44]. The data and poses were analyzed on Pymol program.

The results for the in-component show no conceptual differences and their main figures are replicated in Supporting Information S2 (Figures S2–S4). Disease Mitigation and Epidemic Threshold Before analyzing the robustness of the size of the out-component , we briefly review the disease mitigating effects of the temporal network structure. In a time-aggregated representation of a network, any primary infection will cause secondary infections as long as there is at least one outgoing edge during the observation period. In temporal networks, the occurrence of secondary infections is more constrained, as the infectious period  limits the effective time period between the moment of the primary infection  and the occurrence of an outgoing edge. Given an infectious period , it is possible that  is too small to cause any follow-up outbreak at all. For this reason, we define the outbreak probability  as the fraction of successful secondary outbreaks over the total number of primary infections. Figure 1A shows this outbreak probability as a function of infectious period  for all simulated primary infections. For small infectious periods, the outbreak probability is close to zero, because causal chains are sparse. For increasing , the probability approaches an asymptote, which is defined by the ratio of nodes with at least one outgoing edge in the time-aggregated network. For comparison, this ratio is also plotted as a dashed line. Note that even for  days, the outbreak probability is approximately only half as high as in the time-aggregated case. 10.1371/journal.pone.0055223.g001 Figure 1 Outbreak probabilities (A) and out-component sizes (B) for different infectious periods . Panel A: Outbreak probability  as given by the fraction of primary infections causing at least one secondary infection. The dashed line shows the outbreak probability of the time-aggregated network, i.e. the fraction of nodes with non-vanishing out-degree. Panel B: Average out-components of primary infections, i.e. the number of follow-up infections. The 50% confidence interval is indicated by the shaded area. Only for  a significant fraction of the network can be infected. For increasing , both values approach a saturation. For  days, approximately every second primary infection will cause follow-up infections which will reach on average  of the network. Both numbers are significantly lower than their counterparts in the static network, as indicated by the dashed line. Here approximately  of all primary infections cause follow-up infections with a mean size of epidemic of almost  of the network. Another interesting measure is the average size of the out-component  for a given , where the average is calculated over all nodes  and all times of primary infection . This quantity is shown in Figure 1B. As before, the dashed line refers to the time-aggregated case. Rocha et al. [23] and Miritello et al. [24] observed a threshold  in their publications on SIR-diseases when considering temporal topologies. For  the average size of the epidemic vanishes and increases abruptly at . Our results exhibit a similar behavior and show significant values only for  days. As for the outbreak probability,  approaches an asymptote that is given by the average size of the out-components in the time-aggregated network. Also for this measure, it should be noted that the average size of the out-component of the time-aggregated network is approximately six times larger, even if  days. Both observations support our argument that a temporal view on the network is essential to capture its dynamics fully. Calculations based on a time-aggregated network strongly overestimate the size and probability of an outbreak. Temporal Heterogeneity of the Out-component We explored the dependence of the out-component  on the time of primary infection  for a node . For illustration purposes we began with an exemplary infectious period of  days and the arbitrarily chosen node . Figure 2A shows the distribution of the size of the out-component . The out-component shows a bimodal behavior. It attained values of  and approximately 6% of the network size. Primary infections with adjacent  often account for similar out-component sizes. 10.1371/journal.pone.0055223.g002 Figure 2 Distribution of  for an exemplary infectious period of  days. Panel A shows the size of the out-component for an exemplary node  as a function of . For many times , the size of the out-component  has similar values close to , but for some  we also find  to vanish. Panel B shows the distribution for all nodes, i.e. the top view of panel A for all nodes of the network. Each horizontal line represents one node, the example node chosen for panel A is indicated by the dotted orange line. For the sake of clarity, only every 100th node is plotted. Nodes are arranged according to their averaged value of  over all  from top to bottom, i.e. the node with the largest averaged out-component is displayed as the top line of the panel. The explanation lies in the temporal sparsity of edges in the network, as illustrated by the following: Let us assume that a node  becomes infected at  and afterwards connects within its infectious period only to one susceptible node  at , i.e. . Accordingly,  becomes infected. If  itself has no contacts to other nodes in the time interval , the epidemic stops. Hence, the out-component contains only . Otherwise, the disease continues to spread and the out-component of  consists of  and its out-component. Now, the out-component of  will be the same for all moments of infection . If  is connected to multiple nodes during its infectious period, small changes in  might trigger few more or less infections as a small number of additional nodes enter or leave the causal chain. Besides small fluctuations of , a bi-modality in the distribution was visible. The values of  were either close to their maximum or very small. This distribution is related to the existence of a giant strongly-connected component in the time-aggregated network . The bi-modally distributed sizes of the out-components of nodes in the time-aggregated network  are reflected in the bi-modal distribution of the size of the out-component of a single node at different times of infection  in the temporal network . For an appropriately chosen , a node with a large out-component in  will also have a large one in , but for an inappropriately chosen  no or almost no other nodes can be reached. Vernon et al. [11] and Bajardi et al. [14] found similar results and explain them with the importance of connecting to the right node, i.e. a hub, at the right time. To allow for a more complete view on the network, Figure 2B depicts  for all nodes . This is a top view of Figure 2A for all nodes of the network. The nodes are arranged along the vertical axis in a descending order from top to bottom according to their mean value . The dotted line marks the example node that is shown in panel A. Most nodes exhibited vanishing out-components for almost all times of infection. This is indicated by the bright region in the lower half of Figure 2B. Only the top 30% of nodes possess a reasonably large out-component. Overall, it became clear that only a small fraction of nodes contributed to the risk of spreading in the network. This feature would be missed in a time-aggregated network study. Ranking of Nodes According to the Out-component To allow for further investigation of the size of the out-component , we focused on the effect of varying infectious periods . We averaged over the starting times  and thus determined the mean values . This limitation is justified by the likely unavailability of information on  in every real-world surveillance scenario, where it is often hard to determine the precise time of primary infection. Hence, the exact value of  is inaccessible. One should recall that the values of any risk-based measure as such are usually of minor importance for disease control. In most cases it is sufficient to identify the nodes that exhibit the highest values with respect to a particular measure. In fact, these will be the ones where interventions are most promising. In order to locate these nodes, it is sufficient to order the nodes for each  by the value of  in a ranking . Figure 3 presents the rankings  of the top 100 nodes. These nodes had on average the largest out-component, where the average is also calculated over all infectious periods , i.e. . Each curve corresponds to one node and the red curve represents an arbitrarily chosen node highlighted for illustration purposes. For infectious periods , the ranking was very unstable and the average over both  and  was not reliable. As  increased, however, it became more and more stable. In this regime, the rank of the top nodes did not change significantly. This means that for infectious periods that are long enough, the importance of explicitly considering a ranking for a given  decreases. 10.1371/journal.pone.0055223.g003 Figure 3 Ranking of nodes according to their mean out-component size . Each curve corresponds to one node. The top hundred nodes with the largest out-components are shown. Curves representing nodes with higher ranking are darker than those with lower rankings. For illustration purposes an arbitrarily chosen node is displayed in red. Robustness of Sampling Under Inaccurate Infectious Periods For the purpose of disease control, it is desirable to know the set of nodes  with the highest ranking according to a risk-based measure, where the number of top-ranked nodes, i.e.  is predetermined by the given resources, e.g. the available number of vaccine doses. It is therefore crucial to investigate to what extend the composition of such a top sample depends on the infectious period , or more accurately, it is important to analyze the sensitivity of  on an error . The value of  is given by the accuracy, in which the infectious period  can be estimated. The sample  is determined by thresholding the ranking. Only nodes with a ranking above threshold will be included into the sample. This sensitivity can be analyzed by investigating the intersection  for any pair . The ranking is independent of , if  for every pair . In general, however, this will not be the case, and the size of the intersection  will be a function of . Additionally it will also depend on the sample size . The size of the intersection  can be conveniently normalized by , so that  is the relative intersection. The measure  can be used to characterize the similarity of two rankings. A further reduction of the dimensionality is possible by recalling disease control requirements. Since one is primarily interested in the sensitivity of  with respect to an error ,  can be averaged over all pairs  with  for a given sample size . This yields a quantity  that corresponds to the robustness of a top sample with respect to inaccuracies in the infectious period. Analogous averaging over all  with  yields  corresponding to the robustness of a top sample with respect to the relative error . Figure 4 presents the relative intersections  and  for three different sample sizes , that is for , , and  of all nodes. The 50% confidence interval is given by the shaded areas. 10.1371/journal.pone.0055223.g004 Figure 4 Robustness of samples based on the out-component size of nodes. Shown are the mean intersections  and  for three different sample sizes  (red),  (blue), and  (green) of the network representing approximately , , or  nodes, respectively. The sampling is calculated based on the mean largest out-component over all  and  (see text for details).  is based on averaging over all pairs  with  or  respectively. Confidence intervals are given by the shaded areas. One can see that  decreased with larger errors . This holds for all three sample sizes. But also for very small samples in the order of  of the network, a robustness of  existed for errors of . This means that, on average, half of the nodes in any such sample were identical and independent of the exact value of the infectious period used for evaluation. The definite number of identical nodes in such a sample could be analogously determined and yielded  for  (not shown). To account for the high variability in the ranking  for small infectious periods (see Figure 3), one could consider sampling only for  to include only the nodes with the highest overall risk in the sample. Supporting Information S3 (Figure S5) shows that this would further improve the robustness of a sample. However, no fundamental differences occur. Comparison of the Dynamic Out-component and Static Measures Finally we compared our proposed measure to centrality measures on a static network representation. We followed the approach described in the previous section. Accordingly we determined the intersection of two top samples, i.e. the highest ranked nodes. One top sample is based on the dynamic out-component, the other on a selection of static centrality measures. In detail we compared  with the static out-component, the out-degree, betweenness and k-core centrality. In Figure 5 we show the respective intersections as a function of the sample size for two different infectious periods . Only for samples bigger than  of the network, i.e. more than  nodes the intersection took non-vanishing values. Hence central nodes in static network representations are likely to be different from those with a large temporal out-component. 10.1371/journal.pone.0055223.g005 Figure 5 Comparison between the dynamic out-component and static measures. The relative size of the intersection of the top nodes is based on their value of the dynamic out-component and on static measures of centrality. In the upper panel the comparison for a fixed infectious period of  days is shown and in the lower one for a fixed infectious period of  days."],"thought_2":["Comprehensive Classification of Disease-to-gene Associations Contained in Currently Available Diseasomes The projection in networks of the genetic associations data, available in OMIM and Orphanet, shows different patterns of connectivity among diseases and mutated genes (Figure 1A). Thus, we proceeded to build updated versions of existing models of disease networks, the “human disease network” (HDN) [10] and the “orphan disease network” (ODN) [11]. Subsequently, we classified all disease-gene associations of HDN and ODN in order to get an insight regarding their global distribution. For this purpose, we retrieved a total of 2525 and 2331 genes from HDN and ODN, respectively. Each gene dataset was subdivided in four different classes (Tables S3 and S4 for HDN and ODN respectively) according to our proposed criteria (Figure 1C): two monotropic classes (MD-MG and PD-MG) and two pleiotropic classes (MD-PG and PD-PG). Monotropic subsets are exclusive because their relationship with the disease is unique so genes take part in only one subset and they represent 72% and 69% of the total genes in HDN and ODN, respectively. In contrast, pleiotropic genes can be related to monogenic as well as to polygenic diseases so they can be present in both pleiotropic subsets. The abundance of genes in each subset indicates how genetic association studies tend to distribute genes with different degrees of specificity for pathologies. In both networks, monotropic genes are found to be the most abundant ones, irrespective of the actual number of genes involved in the diseases (Table 2). For instance, “biunivocal” genes (MD-MG subset genes) represent over 56% and 30% of HDN and ODN genes respectively (Table 2). Even more, genes included in the PD-MG class are the most abundant ones in orphan disease network reaching 39% of the total genes. Many PD-MG associations could involve highly co-regulated genes (i.e. coding genes for different subunits of multi-protein complexes), so these genes can be considered a whole functional unit. In this case, we suspect that biunivocal relationships might be underestimated. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.t002 Table 2 Distribution of disease-to-gene associations on proposed classification. Human Diseases Network Orphan Disease Networks Subset Diseases per gene Genes (%) Diseases per gene Genes (%) MD-MG 1.00 1431 (56.7) 1.00 717 (30.8) MD-PG 2.57 639 (25.3) 2.71 435 (18.7) PD-MG 0.46 379 (15.0) 0.40 908 (39.0) PD-PGa 2.13 371 (14.7) 1.68 584 (25.1) All genesb 1.24 2525 (100) 0.91 2331 (100) a Pleiotropic genes associated with at least one polygenic diseases. b All genes in HDN and ODN respectively. The ratios of diseases per gene agree with a pathological convergence (exclusive associations) and divergence (non exclusive associations) for monotropic and pleiotropic genes respectively (Table 2). These results are obvious taking into account our classification criteria. However, they provide a panoramic view of how a set of clinical features (pathophenotypes) observed in patients reach consensus and are attributed to a disease. These results seem to show a human annotation bias that can affect the current disease classifications. Features of Disease Causing Gene Networks (Unipartite Projections) From the bipartite projections (disease-to-gene) of HDN and ODN, we built their corresponding unipartite projections (gene-to-gene) (as can be seen in Figure 1A), named as “human disease causing gene network” (HDGN) and “orphan disease causing gene network” (ODGN) respectively (Figures 3A and 3B). Both unipartite projections are based on the emergence of gene-to-gene relationships (edges) inferred from pair of genes co-associated with at least one disease (Figure 1A). Accordingly, all genes in the MD-MG subsets and those uniquely associated with monogenic diseases in MD-PG will appear as unconnected genes in unipartite projections (HDGN and ODGN). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g003 Figure 3 Unipartite gene-to-gene projections of the disease networks and the pathophenotypic similarity gene network. Human diseases genetic network (HDGN in panel A), Orphan diseases genetic network (ODGN in Panel B) and Human pathophenotype similarity gene network (PSGN in panel C). PSGN consists of one connected component (with a few unconnected genes), in contrast to HDGN and ODGN that show a great variety of isolated patterns of association. All unconnected genes (nodes) correspond to those uniquely associated with monogenic diseases, all of them were excluded in unipartite projections. HDGN include 749 genes (nodes) and 2654 inferred gene-gene relationships (edges) among them (Figure 3A and Table S1). However, ODGN is twice as larger as HDGN with 1492 genes and 6380 inferred gene-gene relationships (Figure 3B and Table S2). At first glance, the topological structures of unipartite networks (HDGN and ODGN) are quite similar (Figures 3A and 3B) although an enrichment of unconnected nodes in HDGN is clear when compared to ODGN (1776 and 839 for HDGN and ODGN respectively). This enrichment is mainly due to the higher number of biunivocal relationships (MD-MG) in HDGN (Table 2). Therefore, this is the reason why HDGN shows fewer inferred relationships (2654) than ODGN (6380). We carried out an analysis of the intersection between both unipartite networks (HDGN and ODGN) to assess an estimation of their similarity. But first we removed all unconnected nodes because they were not considered structural components of these networks. The resulting intersection was 481 genes (intersected nodes) and 662 inferred gene-gene relationships (intersected edges) corresponding to 24% and 10% of edges in HDGN and ODGN respectively (Table 3). Both networks show a Jaccard coefficient of similarity (number of edges in the intersection divided by the number of edges in the union) of 7.9% (Table 3). Surprisingly, the similarity is lower than expected a priori which indicates strong differences between the two data sources (OMIM and Orphanet). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.t003 Table 3 Network intersection analysis between HDGN and ODGN. Network features Values Number of nodes in HDGN 749 Number of nodes in ODGN 1492 Number of edges in HDGN 2654 Number of edges in ODGN 6380 Observed nodes in the intersection 481 Observed edges in the intersection 662 Percentage of edges in HDGN 24.94 Percentage of edges in ODGN 10.38 Jaccard coefficient of similarity 0.079a a Fraction of edges in the intersection respect to the total edges in the union. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the absence of a systematic procedure in the phenotypically characterization of genetic diseases will affect the utility of network medicine methods. In particular, it leads to the isolation of genes and diseases from their real pathological processes, making it practically impossible to identify groups or subgroups of related pathologies. This observed tendency to the exclusiveness (that is to say, the abundance of monotropic gene-disease relationships) considerably increases the disease-gene association specificity that may be of interest for genetic testing. Features of Pathophenotypic Similarity Gene Network (PSGN) The exclusiveness mentioned above could affect pathological processes with many disease variants. In the case of these diseases, some genes play a primary role in the progression of the pathology but others modulate the phenotypic variability. To tackle this problem, HPO offers possibilities for a formal study of the pathophenotypic relationships among genes on the bases of their semantic similarities (pathophenotypic similarities). Therefore, we defined the pathophenotypic space of each gene, consisting of the set of HPO terms associated with the gene (as shown in Figure 1B). These spaces were described using only specific HPO terms, those farthest terms from the root of the ontology, to calculate the semantic similarity value between every two given genes (see methods, Table S7). Higher values of semantic similarity indicate greater specificity in the common pathophenotypic space between a pair of genes. It is known that ontology-based phenotypic similarity methods can also contribute to improve disease-causing gene networks based on phenotypic information built with text-mining analysis [42] or random-walk trajectories between genes considering the ontology as a simple graph [43]. From all calculated pathophenotypic similarities greater than zero, we selected the top 2% of more significant pairs of genes. This selection provides the pathophenotypic similarity gene network (PSGN) with 1075 genes and 26197 gene-to-gene pathophenotypic similarities (Figure 3C and Table S7). Disease-causing gene networks (HDGN and ODGN) exhibit explicit structural differences when they are compared to PSGN (Figure 3); for instance, PSGN consists of only one giant connected component (Figure 3C), which is not the case for HDGN and ODGN. Almost all the pathophenotypic gene annotations used in HPO originally come from OMIM and they represent the sum of all clinical features of diseases associated with a gene. Accordingly, the pathophenotypic similarity for a gene is somehow dependent on the number of diseases associated with this gene (see methods section). Hence, we proceed with a comprehensive study to assess whether the pathophenotypic similarity can be used to reinterpret the pathological relationships between genes (see supplementary methods and discussion in Methods S1). Pathophenotypic Similarity Reveals a New Understanding of Pathological Relationships The survey of the mutual coverage between PSGN and each unipartite projection (HDGN and ODGN) was carried out with an analysis of their intersections. The resulting intersections of PSGN with each unipartite projection proved 528 shared nodes and 1055 shared edges for HDGN and 931 and 1669 for ODGN (Table 4). Therefore, 39% and 26% of inferred pathological relationships intersect with pathophenotypic similarities of PSGN, even improving the intersection between disease causing gene networks (mentioned above). The Jaccard coefficient of similarity of the intersection of PSGN with each pathological network was 3.8% and 5.4% for HDGN and ODGN respectively (Table 4). This can be considered an interesting performance value if we take into account the dependence on the Jaccard coefficient on the different sizes of compared networks (the number of edges in the union are 27796 for HDGN and 30908 for ODGN). Furthermore, there are about 25000 new pathophenotypic similarities, excluding inferred pathological relationships, to be used for the discovery of new underlying pathological relationships among genes. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.t004 Table 4 Network intersection analysis between PSGN and HDGN or ODGN.

Topological analysis exhibits the emergence of unnoticed pathological relationships We have also studied how genes in PSGN are distributed in comparison to HDGN and ODGN. Subsequently, we analyzed the degree distribution of genes for each network (HDGN, ODGN and PSGN), as well as for their respective gene subsets (MD-MG, MD-PG, PD-MG and PD-PG of HDN and ODN). We carried out a Mann-Whitney test to assess the significance of the difference of the degree distribution of each subset in their respective disease-causing gene network and in PSGN (Figure 4, a boxplot was used in all the cases). In agreement with our classification criteria, MD-MG genes (bi-univocal) have null connectivity in their respective disease-causing gene networks (Figure 4A). By contrast, MD-MG genes are phenotypically linked to a mean of 25 genes in PSGN indicating an expansion of pathophenotypic relationships between disease-causing genes in PSGN (Figure 4B). In pathological networks, degree distributions are significantly different for ODGN subsets (PD-MG and PD-PG) but not for HDGN subsets (see their correspondent p-values in Figure 4A). On the other hand, degree distributions in PSGN are quite similar when compared to the equivalent subsets of HDGN and ODGN, where higher node degree for pleiotropic genes and lower for monotropic genes can be appreciated (Figure 4B). In addition, Spearman's rank correlation test was used to explore degree correlations between the pathophenotypic similarity (PSGN) and disease-causing gene networks (HDGN and ODGN) (Table S8). Weak (but statistically significant) positive correlations were found between gene pathological and pathophenotypical relationships (Table S8). These results, as shown in Figure 4 and Table S8, clearly show that gene degrees in pathological networks differ from those calculated using pathophenotypic similarities. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g004 Figure 4 Degree distribution of subset genes in pathological and pathophenotypic gene-to-gene networks.

In bold and red, significant p-values. (*) Mean values. (#) Subsets of completely unconnected genes. The (apparently) most striking observation is that genes uniquely associated with monogenic diseases (genes in MD-MG and many of MD-PG) are present in PSGN. The vast majority of these genes appeared as unconnected genes in the unipartite projections of HDN and ODN (as shown in Figure 3). This means that pathophenotypic similarities lead to the emergence of novel relationships that remained hidden in the gene-to-gene projections of current diseasomes. Specific contribution of gene subsets to gene-to-gene pathophenotypic similarities In light of the result discussed above, we consider it necessary to prove the contribution of each type of gene subset to the gene-to-gene similarities of PSGN. This could help to unveil the relationship between the pathological convergences or divergences and the pathophenotypic similarities [30]. Therefore, we analyzed the abundance of pathological phenotypes and the average pathophenotypic similarity per gene. Figure 5 (panels A and B) represents the distribution of the abundance of pathophenotypes (HPO terms) in genes for HDN and ODN subsets. Pleiotropic genes show distributions significantly different to the distribution of all genes included in PSGN using a Mann-Whitney test (see their correspondent low p-values for MD-PG and PD-PG, Figure 5 panels A and B). On the other hand, monotropic genes seem to be well represented in the pathophenome (whole genes of PSGN) showing only slight differences in the distribution of PD-MG subset for ODN (see the p-value for PD-MG in Figure 5B). Consequently, we can be confident that the phenotypic descriptions used for monotropic genes are not underestimated and they are enough to calculate their pathophenotypic similarities to other genes. By contrast, as expected, pleiotropic genes tend to be annotated in the ontology with more clinical features compared to the whole gene annotations. For an overall estimation of how each subset contributes to the pathophenotypic co-dependence between genes, we calculated the average of pathophenotypic similarity values associated with each gene in the PSGN in order to compare their distributions in different subsets (Figures 5C and 5D). The monotropic subsets contain genes with the highest specific relationships to diseases. Nevertheless, monotropic subsets show very different behavior compared to all genes of the PSGN in the distribution of the average pathophenotypic similarities related to genes within HDN and ODN subsets (see the low p-values for MD-MG and PD-MG in Figures 5C and 5D). MD-MG subsets show lower average pathophenotypic similarity values (Figures 5C and 5D). As a result, these distributions also reveal pathophenotypic relationships among genes that remained lost in the gene-to-gene unipartite projections of HDN and ODN. The distributions of PD-MG subsets show higher average phenotypic similarities between genes (observe that the green curves in Figures 5C and 5D are displaced to the right when compared to the respective red curves, as well as to the rest of curves). This observation could be mainly due to the fact that they are sharing similar sets of annotations, and in many cases they are functional units or strongly co-regulated molecular complexes. With regards to pleiotropic subsets, they seem to be slightly affected by the number of genes involved in the disease (monogenic and polygenic). Nonetheless, their abundance of pathophenotypes could increase the number of non-specific relationships between genes. In this case, non-specific relationships will tend to show low values of similarities decreasing the average value associated with genes. In fact, this agrees with the higher connectivity observed for pleiotropic subsets in both HDN and ODN (Figure 4). For this reason, we analyzed the degree of association between the abundance of pathophenotype per gene and the average similarity value per gene. A weak Spearman correlation was obtained (p-value 1.8E−26 and rs = −0.25, Figure S2) so we can ensure no clear dependence between both parameters. However, there is a tendency to decrease the mean value of pathophenotypic similarity for genes with abundant HPO terms annotations. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g005 Figure 5 Distributions of the number of pathophenotypes and pathophenotypic similarities in each subset. MD-MG (red line), MD-PG (orange line), PD-MG (green line), PD-PG (blue line) and PSGN (Black line). Upper panels represent the cumulative frequency of the number of specific pathophenotypes annotated for genes in HDN (C) and ODN (D) subsets, the whole set of genes in HPO (PSGN) was used as the reference distribution. Lower panels represent the cumulative frequency of the average pathophenotypic similarity associated with genes in HDN (C) and ODN (D) subsets, the whole set of genes in HPO (PSGN) was used as the reference distribution. The p-values, included in each legend, represent the mean of the resulting p-values after 1000 non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test) where each subset was compared, each time, with a random sample of the pathophenome of the same size of the subset (see methods). Apparently, the use of semantic similarity measurements produces a rearrangement in the pathophenotypic co-dependence between genes overcoming the bias that can be introduced from the original source of data, the Morbid Map. However, the gene pleiotropy dampens their average pathophenotypic similarity values indicating a rise of unspecific relationships with other genes compared to monotropic genes. This observation reinforces our suggestion that the representation of diseasomes as unipartite projections is insufficient to study other underlying (and not necessarily obvious) pathophenotypic relationships. Overview of the Relationship between Metabolic or Essential Genes and Pathophenotypic Similarity Taking into account that metabolic and essential disease genes represent about 18% and 34% respectively of the total disease-causing genes, we also studied how they are represented in each subset of genes in our classification (Table 5). The subsequent study of cumulative frequencies per gene of the associated pathopenotypes (Figure 6A) and the average pathophenotypic similarity values (Figure 6B) suggest that gene subsets tend to be associated with different biological properties. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g006 Figure 6 Distributions of the number of pathophenotypes and the pathophenotypic similarities for metabolic and essential genes.

Enrichment of metabolic genes in the MD-MG subclass Biunivocal classes (MD-MG) are markedly enriched in metabolic coding genes with respect to the other classes; on the contrary, PD-MG is underrepresented by metabolic enzymes. On the other hand, the pathophenotypes corresponding to metabolic genes do not differ from those of the whole pathophenome (see non-significant p value in Figure 6A). However, the mean value of phenotypic similarity is lower for metabolic genes than for the whole pathophenome (Figure 6B). For instance, metabolic genes tend to be involved in more specific pathological processes and exclusively related to pathophenotypes recognized as genetic diseases. It seems relevant that metabolic genes are mainly enriched in the MD-MG subset: 67% and 49% of the whole set of genes in MGN are MD-MG for HDGN and ODGN, respectively. In addition, metabolic genes show a lower distribution of the mean values of pathophenotypes compared to the whole pathophenome (Figure 6). Therefore, dysfunctions in metabolic genes prove a functional bias in disease and gene association studies toward the pathophenotypic specificity (Figure 6). At least two factors could contribute to explain this observation: first, the molecular basis of metabolic dysfunctions can be more precisely identified in these diseases; second, these diseases exhibit pathophenotypes with highly distinguishable features. In any case, both factors can be influenced by the application of routine biochemical analysis in the clinical setup, which allows an easier detection of abnormal concentrations of metabolites in blood or urine. Enrichment of essential genes in the pleiotropic subsets Zhang et al. [11] have reported an enrichment of essential genes in ODN with respect to HDN but our results suggest that both networks show a similar proportion of essential genes (Table 5). In particular, the results shown in Table 5 also indicate that an enrichment of essential genes is produced in pleiotropic gene subclasses. The number of pathophenotypes associated with essential genes is significantly higher than that obtained when using all genes in the PSGN (Figure 6A). But their distribution of mean values of phenotypic similarities is statistically indistinguishable from that of the whole pathophenome (Figure 6B). Some previous network medicine works have discussed how essential genes are represented in different diseaseomes [10], [11], [30]. Barabasi and co-workers concluded that disease-causing genes are not essential genes because their associated lethality could have severe consequences [10]. Chavali et al. [30] proposed two different topological features for phenotypically divergent genes and essential disease genes, inter-modular and intra-modular hubs respectively. Zhang et al. [11] in their analysis of the orphan disease network found that ODs are enriched in essential genes as compared with the whole set of diseases. In contrast, when we compared the same essential gene dataset used by these authors in the updated versions of HDN and ODN, no detectable differences were found (Table 5). Our observation differs from that of Zhang et al. [11], maybe due to the use an updated version of both disease-causing gene networks and the same dataset of essential genes. In any case, our results do not support the idea that there could be a negative correlation between gene essentiality and disease prevalence. Nonetheless, it seems that there is a certain enrichment of essential genes in the subsets of “pleoiotropic” genes, that is, those associated with more than one disease (Table 5). This result agrees with observed by Chavali et al. in the dataset of shared genes by diseases [30]. The dataset of essential genes used in these works [10], [11], [30] are human orthologous of lethal mouse genes catalogued in the Mouse Genome database [44]. From our point of view, the enrichment of essential genes in pleiotropic disease-causing genes leads to interesting evolutionary questions on how mutations in these genes are related to their lethality for other mammals and might be involved in the limits of human evolvability [45], [46]. Integrative Analysis of PSGN Built biomolecular interactomes (PIN, MGN and FSGN) The heterogeneity of the cellular interactions among genes affects (either directly or indirectly) the progression of the diseases [13]. Thus, the disturbances caused by genetic mutations can be transmitted in biological systems in several distinct ways. Three different biomolecular interactomes were built to study the association between the pathophenotypic similarity and each type of biological interaction (physical, metabolic and functional interactions). PIN results in 9580 genes connected through 74657 physical interactions (Table S5). MGN contains 535 enzyme-coding genes interconnected by 9812 flux correlations (Table S5). The top 0.5% of functional similarities in the branch of biological processes in the Gene Ontology corresponds to FSGN. FSGN results in 9157 genes and 496973 significant functional similarities (Table S5). For each biomolecular interactome, we evaluated their coverage in PSGN and the contribution of each type of biological interaction to the score of pathophenotypic similarity. Network comparison analysis between biomolecular interactomes and PSGN ‘A network intersection analysis was carried out using the PSGN as reference and the biomolecular interactomes (PIN, MGN or FSGN) as queries. Nevertheless, the observed differences in size and density of the studied networks could be the cause that the direct network comparison analysis would provide no useful significance values. Therefore, we decided to standardize the contents of the networks by using the intersection of nodes (see methods section) to minimize differences between the reference (PSGN) and the rest of the networks (PIN, MGN or FSGN). This step (Figure S1) provoked a strong structural decomposition from all the original networks that resulted in sub-networks (Table S6). Although we reduced the size differences between the intersected networks, other features are still preserved like the density of edges, which are inherent to the nature of each network (Table 6). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.t006 Table 6 Counts of nodes and edges in the comparison of PSGN and biomolecular interactomes.

The query is PSGN and used reference corresponds to each biomolecular interactomes. The network comparison results show statistically significant intersections of edges for all biomolecular interactome sub-networks compared to their respective PSGN sub-network (Table 7). This was not the case for randomized networks used as negative controls. The hypergeometric test shows a lower significance of the pathophenotypic similarities resulting in the intersection between PSGN and MGN when compared to PIN and FSGN (Table 7). Nevertheless, the Jaccard coefficient of similarity between biomolecular interactomes and their respective PSGN sub-network was higher for MGN and FSGN (9.8% and 5.4% respectively) than for PIN (2.5%). In this sense, both the percentage of edges remaining in the reference sub-network and the Jaccard coefficient of similarity seem to be good indicators of the size of the phenotypic space covered by the intersection (Table 7). The 23.7% of physical interactions between diseases-causing genes match with pathophenotypic similarities, 11.7% and 8.1% for metabolic flux correlation and functional interactions respectively. FSGN showed the largest and most significant coverage in PSGN (Table 7), which means that the functional relationships of genes based on biological processes define the broadest context of the molecular mechanisms associated with disease-causing genes. Concerning biochemical interactomes (PIN and MGN), PIN exhibits a greater coverage of genes at the intersection than MGN, although the latter presents the highest Jaccard coefficient of similarity (Table 7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.t007 Table 7 Significance of the number of edges at the resulting intersection in the network analysis comparison.

Specific contribution of biomolecular interactions to pathophenotypic similarities Most of the published network biology studies have made use of the degree of a node (number of connections with other nodes) to assess its relevance in a network. In fact, node degree has been extensively used in physical interaction networks [10], [11], [30], [31] but also in metabolic networks [15], [32]. In this work, a topological analysis was carried out in different biomolecular interactomes to calculate the degree of genes (based on gene-to-gene interactions). To estimate whether the abundance of biological interactions for genes is correlated with the number of phatophenotypic similarities in PSGN, we carried out a Spearman's rank correlation test of gene degrees. This test showed weak, but statistically significant, positive correlations between gene degrees for the whole set of genes (p-value = 2.0E−07, r = 0.15 for HDN; p-value = 3.2E−08, r = 0.16 for ODN) when PIN was compared to PSGN. No significant correlations were found when either MGN or FSGN were compared to PSGN (Table S9). The values for the different subsets obtained in this analysis clearly show that only physical interactions bear some relation with the abundance of pathophenotypic similarities in pleiotropic genes associated with monogenic diseases (MD-PG). Accordingly, mutations in MD-PG genes seem to “diverge” disturbances more efficiently by protein-protein interactions that determine a pathophenotypic and functional relationship between genes. This result suggests that these genes co-participate in different variants of a given disease and there are functional co-dependencies among them. Thus, we proceeded to assess whether the specificity of the pathophenotypic similarity between genes depends on their type of biological interaction. For that reason, we performed a validation analysis through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to prove the signal in pathophenotypic similarities produced by each biomolecular interactome in PSGN (Figure 7). PIN and MGN showed higher average areas under the ROC curves (AUC values of 0.77 and 0.76, respectively) than functional interactions with an average AUC of 0.66 (Figure 7). Both biochemical interactomes have a strong signal, as depicted by ROC far from the straight line representing randomness (Figure 7). This observation reinforces the idea that strong synergies occur between genes involved in biochemical interactions. The functional network (Figure 7) also shows a signal clearly departed from the straight line representing randomness that is consistent with previous works [27]. However, one should be aware that there is always some degree of nonspecific relationships that can introduce noise in this kind of analysis. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g007 Figure 7 Receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve performance by biomolecular interactions of pathophenotypic similarities. Physical interactions (dashed blue line), metabolic flux correlations (dashed green line), functional interactions (red continuous line) and an integrated interactome generated by the sum of all other interactomes (black continuous line). ROC curves were computed to assess the signal of pathophenotypic similarities for biological interactions. True positives (TP) were those interactions that where found in the intersection between PSGN and each biomolecular interactome (PIN, MGN and FSGN). The dataset of false positives (FP) was calculated from intersected gene pairs between PSGN and randomizations of each biomolecular interactome. We obtained severals different FP datasets to calculate the average area under the curve (AUC), it was 0.77 for PIN, 0.76 for MGN, 0.66 for FSGN and 0.68 for the integrated interactome. Only biochemical interactomes show significantly different AUCs to that of the integrated interactome (average p-values of 2.2E−6 and 4.1E−2 for PIN and MGN respectively). Merging modular components of MSUD using pathophenotypic similarity We analyzed a metabolic disorder named as maple syrup urine disease (MSUD, MIM 248600). MSUD is a genetic disease grouped into aminoacidurias and caused by a decreased activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. It catalyzes the first steps for the degradation of branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine). This enzymatic complex has three subunits (E1, E2, and E3) encoded by four different genes BCKDHA-E1A (Entrez GeneID 593), BCKDHB-E1B (Entrez GeneID 594), DBT-E2 (Entrez GeneID 1629), and DLD-E3 (Entrez GeneID 1738). This inborn error of metabolism is genetically and phenotypically well characterized [47]. The classical clinical features associated with MSDU are: maple syrup odor in cerumen (hours after birth), increased levels of branched -chain amino-acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), ketonuria, signs of deepening encephalopathy, coma and central respiratory failure. We retrieved a map of all pathophenotypes annotated for MSUD-causing genes (Figure S3). From PSGN, we retrieved all gene pairs including at least one of the MSUD causing genes, but before we removed a dense cluster linked to DLD due to Leigh syndrome (Figure 8 A). Some of the resulting genes also present direct or non-direct metabolic flux correlations with BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DBT or DLD (Figure 8 A) and most of them take part in different reactions of the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway (Figure 8 B). This evidence that integrating functional co-dependencies and pathophenotypic similarities merge apparently non-related genes into a module of the molecular pathobiology. Furthermore, we can breakdown the module relationships to map shared pathophenotypes between genes (Figure 8 C). For instance, IVD and ACADM are genes included in MD-MG subsets for both HDN and ODN. However, in this sub-network (Figure 8 A) we detect that they are sharing pathophenotypes with MSUD genes (Figure 8 C). It is possible to identify the set of the most specific pathophenotypes for MSUD, elevated plasma branched chain aminoacids or hallucinations. In addition, PCCA and PCCB appear with similar clinical biochemistry parameters highly correlated with MSUD, such as high levels of lactic acid and ketone bodies (Figure 8 C). In contrast, other pathophenotypes point to disorders at a systemic or pathophysiological level, such as cerebral edema, pancreatitis, lethargy and coma (Figure 8 C). Nevertheless, these genes are grouped in the same biological context (Figure 8 B) and, it is important to remark, that all of them are in the mitochondrial matrix. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g008 Figure 8 Maple syrup urine disease pathological and metabolic interactions.

(C) Pathophenotypes shared between genes in the same metabolic module. This metabolic syndrome illustrates the potentials of PSGN. This network provides novel pathological similarities between genes and outlines the pathobiology and functional context of disease-causing genes using metabolic interactions. Overlapped physical and pathophenotypic interactions disregarded in unipartite projections Finally, given the relevance of the physical interactions, we carried out a manual exploration of the intersection between PIN and PSGN. This is to remove all those gene-to-gene edges in both HDGN and ODGN from the resulting intersection. This resulted in the selection of all the disregarded relationships between genes in unipartite projections of diseasomes that are phenotypically and physically related (Figure 9 and Table S10). Therefore, tuning the balance between the “noise” and the confidence of interactions may improve the predictive power of new disease-related genes using network medicine approaches based on pathophenotypic term. 10.1371/journal.pone.0056653.g009 Figure 9 Physical interactions between genes with similar phenotypic lost in the current networks of diseases. This figure is the result of the difference of the resulting intersection between PSGN and PIN after removing those interactions present in HDGN and ODGN. Those genes that are MD-MG in HDN and ODN have been coloured in orangeThese genes indicate that they present underlying pathophenotypical relationships with other genes that had been disregarded by the inference of shared disease genes. Conclusions Current studies in medical genetics are mainly centered in establishing associations among diseases and genetic variations for personalized medicine. Many of these genetic variations are located in intragenic regions of DNA and they constitute the basic data to build disease-causing gene networks [10], [11]. These networks are useful to find new genetic interactions between diseases, as well as to predict the influence of gene functions in existing pathologies [48]–[50]. In the present work, we have classified the different patterns of gene-disease associations in four subsets according to two different criteria (MD-MG, MD-PG, PD-MG, PD-PG, as depicted in Figure 1C). This is in contrast to previously published works in which only one criterion was used, either specific and shared genes by diseases [30] or monogenic or polygenic disease-causing genes [31], [51]. Our findings indicate that the inferred associations are insufficient to describe properly both interactions among diseases and among genes. This effect can be easily observed when analyzing bipartite graphs composed of gene-to-disease edges. In these networks, more than 30% of the genes participate in “bi-univocal” relationships (that is, genes associated exclusively with a single disease). This specificity can be useful for diagnostics, but it makes it more difficult to establish groups or to identify interactions among diseases. On the other hand, our results have also uncovered an enrichment of metabolic genes in bi-univocal subsets, as well as an enrichment of essential genes in pleiotropic subsets. The lack of cellular and molecular phenotyping platforms constrains the possibility to detect shared features among pathologies. Consequently, this reduces the possibilities of generating new knowledge on the molecular bases of the pathophenotypic profiles, to distinguish classes and subclasses of a given disease more precisely [7], [11], [26]. However, medical semantics remains the standard tool to establish the sets of observed clinical features associated with pathologies. In the case of diseases with predominantly genetic origins, pathophenotypes are usually very conserved among patients. We have shown that pathophenotypic similarity gene networks can be a great resource to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in the responses of organisms to genetic disturbances. For instance, it shows to be useful to merge biomolecular components involved in a same pathological process like MSUD. In the future, network integration and standardization of molecular and cellular phenotypes could improve the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms involved in pathological processes. Further experimental and analytical efforts in this direction are warranted."],"prob":["figur, sampl, cluster, tabl, differ, number, two"],"frex":["cluster, figur, network, top, pair, plot, s2"],"lift":["subnetwork, sub-network, pc2, interactom, network-bas, pc1, undirect"],"score":["figur, cluster, sampl, network, tabl, node, plot"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["fit, assumpt, model, assum, probabl, estim, intercept"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[69],"thought_1":["One-stage Versus Two-stage Methods\nResults in Table 2 and Table S3 indicate that one- and two-stage methods often yield similar estimates for pooled factor-outcome associations, but importantly not always. For example, for the factor par we found an odds ratio of 1.45 (Model∼1 using MLE) versus 1.32 (Model∼5 using MLE). Occasionally, differences led to the one-stage and two-stage models disagreeing upon statistical significance (e.g. eryt). These differences mainly occurred when relatively few data were available per study (coag and par), or relatively few studies were at hand (eryt and ddim). For instance, the OR of eryt was 1.52 (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.47) for the univariate two-stage approach (using DerSimonian and Laird's MOM estimator), versus 1.35 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.77) for the stratified one-stage approach. Furthermore, one-stage and two-stage methods tend to provide different estimates for standard errors and between-study heterogeneity parameters, leading to different prediction intervals. For instance, the prediction interval for the odds ratio of ddimdich ranged from 8.65 to 36.20 (Model 2 using MLE), versus 14.24 to 24.17 (Model 5 using MLE). Although usually they give similar results, the univariate two-stage method (Model 2) sometimes obtains different conclusions to the bivariate two-stage method (Model 1). For instance, for eryt we respectively found an odds ratio of 1.55 () versus 1.38 () when REML was used as estimation procedure. Finally, the bivariate two-stage method (Model 1) often gives more similar results to the one-stage method. For the factor eryt, we found  with  using Model 1 (bivariate two-stage model), versus  with  for Model 3 (bivariate one-stage model),  with  for Model 4 (reduced one-stage model) and  with  for Model 5 (stratified one-stage model). These estimates were all somewhat different to the results for Model 2 (univariate two-stage MoM) where  with .\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060650.t002Table 2\nEstimated unadjusted factor-outcome associations for the DVT case study.

Statistical significance (p-value), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and 95% prediction intervals (95% PI) are given for the odds ratio (OR). For some one-stage models, estimates could not be obtained because the adaptive Gauss-Hermite approximation did not converge.†Zero-cells occurred in two studies for factor oachst.\nEstimation of Correlation between Random Effects\nAs previously described, only the full one- and two-stage models (Model 1 & Model 3) estimate a parameter for the correlation between random effects. Results in Table 2 demonstrate that these models often yield correlation estimates that are close to +1 or −1, particularly when insufficient data are available and MLE is used. If correlations between random effects are assumed zero (Model 2 & Model 4), we noticed that parameter estimates may considerably change and thereby affect the calculation of p-values and prediction intervals. A good example is the unadjusted factor coag, where the prediction interval for the OR ranged from 0.62 to 2.47 (Model 1 with MLE) versus 0.75 to 2.23 (Model 2 with MLE), and the corresponding p-value decreased from 0.172 to 0.078. Similar findings were obtained for the adjusted analyses (Table 2). Finally, results indicate that the estimated correlation between random effects tends to be less extreme when REML is used (Table 3). The factor surg is a good example, as  decreased from −0.90 (MLE) to −0.65 (REML).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060650.t003Table 3\nEstimated factor-outcome associations in the DVT case study for ddimdich, adjusted for malign, surg and calfdif3.

Results indicate that the estimation of a separate intercept for each study (Model 5) tends to decrease the standard errors and between-study heterogeneity of factor-outcome associations (unless between-study correlations are +1 or −1). This, in turn, resulted in smaller prediction intervals for estimated odds ratios. For instance, the prediction interval for the unadjusted OR of ddimdich ranged from 8.08 to 38.78 (Model 3), versus 14.24 to 24.17 (Model 5). Estimation of One-stage Models\nOne-stage models were estimated with 1 and 5 quadrature points, and sometimes suffered from convergence problems (e.g. par and coag in Table 2 where positive indefiniteness occurred when 5 quadrature points were used). Possibly, these problems are related to poor model specification. Parameter estimates were similar for 1 and 5 quadrature points in the unadjusted analyses, however, some small differences occurred in the adjusted analyses (e.g. ddimdich in Table 3).\nWe have described several random-effects IPD-MA models that implement a one-stage or two-stage method, where one desires to evaluate a potential causal (risk) factor or predictor of outcome. We detailed how they can be estimated and also extended to adjust for other factors. Despite the conventional belief that one-stage and two-stage methods yield similar conclusions [35]–[37], our empirical investigation shows that this is not always the case. Specifically, we found that different estimates for pooled effects, standard errors, between-study heterogeneity and correlation between random effects can result from choosing a different method (one-stage or two-stage), choosing a different estimation procedure (MLE, REML, MOM, number of quadrature points) and choosing a different model specification (independent random effects, joint random effects, stratified estimation). Although these differences were usually not substantial, in the DVT example they lead to discrepancies concerning the statistical significance of age, duration of symptoms, family history of thrombofilia, presence of erythema, presence of paresis and (dichotomized) D-dimer value.Thus, importantly the choice of IPD-MA method may actually influence the conclusions about which factors are thought to be risk factors. This makes it desirable to pre-specify in a study protocol what meta-analysis method will be used, to avoid unjustified post-hoc analyses being performed to achieve statistical significance. We generally recommend that the one-stage method should be used. This method models the exact binomial distribution of the data in each study, and does not require a continuity correction when (partial) separation occurs [61]–[64], [67]. The one-stage method may therefore produce more reliable results than the two-stage method when few studies or few subjects per study are available, as the two-stage method incorrectly assumes asymptotic normality (for the log odds ratio estimates from each study) in such scenarios [67]. The one-stage method further facilitates the adjustment for other factors, which is particularly important in non-randomised settings. In addition, one-stage models are more flexible, for example making the implementation of non-linear associations and interactions straightforward [24], [37], [79]–[82]. Finally, stratification in one-stage models avoids the need for estimating correlations between random effects. One can simply estimate study-specific intercepts and slopes and place the random effect only on the factor of interest.Although we focused on IPD-MA of prognostic factors in this article, the two-stage methods can also be applied when only AD data is available for the included studies. These methods are usually preferred because sharing of IPD is often unfeasible due to, for instance, confidentiality agreements. Results from our empirical example demonstrate that the full two-stage model, which when pooling the AD accounts for heterogeneity of baseline risk and risk factors, and their within-study and between-study correlation, tends to yield most consistent results with the one-stage models. The full two-stage method is a bivariate meta-analysis, which by additionally using the correlation between parameter estimates, is known to have benefits over a univariate me-analysis [43]. The methods presented here could further be extended using methods allowing for the combination of IPD with AD [49], [83], [84]. Potential limitations such as missing data in a subset of studies could be overcome using imputation methods that account for clustering. A Bayesian approach would be the most promising, as it would permit specification of the imputation model alongside the one-stage model, resolving several estimation limitations of the current approaches [32], [85], [86]. Furthermore, Bayesian approaches facilitate sensitivity analyses through adjusting prior specification, and permit the the robustness of fitted models to be evaluated. This is particularly useful when few studies are available and estimated parameters of one- and two-stage models may be severely biased due to estimation difficulties. Future research is needed to evaluate the performance of the described methods, and to compare their accuracy and coverage with Bayesian alternatives.In summary, the choice of one-stage or two-stage method for performing a random-effects IPD-MA may influence the statistical identification of risk factors (predictors) for a binary outcome. When the number of studies in the meta-analysis are large and the number of events in each study are not few, we agree with Stewart et al [37] that a two-stage method will usually suffice. However, we generally recommend that a one-stage IPD-MA method is used as this models the exact binomial distribution, accounts for within-study parameter correlation, offers more flexibility in the model specification and avoids continuity corrections. It is therefore particularly preferable when few studies or few events in some studies are available."],"thought_2":["The estimated model-evidence values  obtained by nested sampling for each model is shown in Tables 7 and 8.

In order to obtain a frequentist -value for the statistic, an empirical probability distribution for  was obtained by randomly selecting a set  of  values from  and determining  for the set, this being done 10000 times. On comparing 0.01298 with this empirical distribution, the -value for  was found to be 0.0276. In contrast, when a sample of size  was obtained by reject sampling from , the value of unweighted  was 0.00630, which has a -value of 0.5772.\nAs a result of this experiment, it was decided not to use  for estimating parameter distributions. Model checking\nIt does not follow that the most probable model from a set of candidate models is necessarily an acceptable model: the most probable model may be the least worst of a set of poor models. What is required is an assessment of the fit of the most probable models to the observed data.\nA common approach to assessing the fit of a model to data is to use a -value with respect to some statistic , where  is observed data. More formally, the classical -value is given by(29)where  is a possible future value, and the probability is taken over the distribution of  given , a single parameter estimate.\nA drawback of (29) is that it does not take account of the uncertainty in  expressed by the posterior distribution .

This suggests a poor fit of the models to the data.\nA visual representation of the fit of data to a model  can be provided by comparing the observed count  (the number of cells containing  bacteria) to the distribution of  possible count values  obtained via (31). This visualisation is shown in Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082317.g009Figure 9\nThe observed number of cells with  bacteria (blue) compared with 95% credibility intervals (red) predicted by Model 3 with respect to the virulent strain.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082317.g010Figure 10\nThe observed number of cells with  bacteria (blue) compared with 95% credibility intervals (red) predicted by Model 5 with respect to the virulent strain.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082317.g011Figure 11\nThe observed number of cells with  bacteria (blue) compared with 95% credibility intervals (red) predicted by Model 7 with respect to the attenuated strain.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082317.g012Figure 12\nThe observed number of cells with  bacteria (blue) compared with 95% credibility intervals (red) predicted by Model 11 with respect to the attenuated strain.\nThe AIC is a common maximum-likelihood approach to model comparison, but nested sampling enables a Bayesian approximation of model evidence  to be computed, along with the advantages of adopting the Bayesian approach. These include integration across parameters; estimation of the posterior parameter distributions (with visualisation of parameter correlations); and estimation of the posterior predictive distributions for goodness-of-fit assessments of the models.Under the assumptions used, the most probable models with respect to the virulent and attenuated strains of S. enterica were burst-threshold Model 3 (Poisson) and burst-rate Model 7 ( only), respectively. The next two most probable models were burst-threshold Model 5 (negative binomial) and burst-rate Model 11 ( plus ), respectively. However, the Bayesian posterior predictive -values indicate that alternative models and/or a relaxation of the quasi-stationary assumption adopted by Brown et al. [24] should be considered. It may be the case that one of the candidate models is correct but the use of pooled data was detrimental.Other assumptions of the underlying mechanistic model may also be wrong; in particular, the absence of bacterial death and the assumption that each released bacterium infects a new macrophage.For both the attenuated and virulent strains, the data  was recorded over a number of days following infection and then pooled, with . If time-dependent data is to be retained and nested sampling is to be applied then a method is required to estimate the likelihood function , where  and  is the number of cells containing  bacteria on the -th day. Branching processes have been used to model a variety of biological systems [36], and we will investigate the potential of estimating  through the use of Bellman-Harris processes to model within-host infection dynamics.We have demonstrated that a visualisation of the marginal and joint posterior parameter distributions  is readily obtainable once model evidence  has been estimated by nested sampling. The estimated joint posterior distributions provided a visualisation of the correlations between the parameters. Through the use of a weighted Kolomogorov-Smirnov test, we also found that the parameter sequence  resulting from nested sampling could not be regarded as a random sample from the posterior parameter distribution .One drawback of Algorithm 2 is that the restricted priors will converge to a single mode when a likelihood is multi-modal, and this will cause the evidence  to be underestimated. This issue can be resolved by implementing a multi-modal version of nested sampling, such as that proposed by Feroz et al. [37] for comparing cosmological models."],"prob":["model, estim, predict, use, variabl, paramet, probabl"],"frex":["fit, assumpt, model, assum, probabl, estim, intercept"],"lift":["out-of-sampl, glmms, model-predict, gelman-rubin, β0, aic, εi"],"score":["model, estim, predict, fit, paramet, covari, simul"],"proportion":["0.01"]}],"topic_no":[30,69]}],"topic_no":[15,50,22,59,63,91,13,78,3,16,62,77,55,25,75,29,88,12,34,68,30,69]}],"topic_no":[71,72,2,10,96,48,99,57,8,24,74,89,94,27,39,43,52,1,90,47,84,100,37,92,41,66,45,87,18,73,15,50,22,59,63,91,13,78,3,16,62,77,55,25,75,29,88,12,34,68,30,69]},{"name":["subject, coeffici, deviat, linear, measur, correl, mean"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[36],"thought_1":["Objective: To use Z-scores to compare different charts of femur length (FL) applied to our population with the aim of identifying the most appropriate chart. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in Beijing. Fifteen hospitals in Beijing were chosen as clusters using a systemic cluster sampling method, in which 15,194 pregnant women delivered from June 20th to November 30th, 2013. The measurements of FL in the second and third trimester were recorded, as well as the last measurement obtained before delivery. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified FL measurements from 19996 ultrasounds from 7194 patients between 11 and 42 weeks gestation. The FL data were then transformed into Z-scores that were calculated using three series of reference equations obtained from three reports: Leung TN, Pang MW et al (2008); Chitty LS, Altman DG et al (1994); and Papageorghiou AT et al (2014). Each Z-score distribution was presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD). Skewness and kurtosis and were compared with the standard normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The histogram of their distributions was superimposed on the non-skewed standard normal curve (mean = 0, SD = 1) to provide a direct visual impression. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of each reference chart for identifying fetuses <5th or >95th percentile (based on the observed distribution of Z-scores) were calculated. The Youden index was also listed. A scatter diagram with the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile curves calculated from and superimposed on each reference chart was presented to provide a visual impression. Results: The three Z-score distribution curves appeared to be normal, but none of them matched the expected standard normal distribution. In our study, the Papageorghiou reference curve provided the best results, with a sensitivity of 100% for identifying fetuses with measurements < 5th and > 95th percentile, and specificities of 99.9% and 81.5%, respectively. Conclusions: It is important to choose an appropriate reference curve when defining what is normal. The Papageorghiou reference curve for FL seems to be the best fit for our population. Perhaps it is time to change our reference curve for femur length."],"thought_2":["Baseline demographic characteristics\nTable 2 shows the baseline demographic characteristics for the enrolled population of our study.

The mean value of the Z-score was 0.8651, and the SD was 1.09136. Skewness and kurtosis were -0.053 and -0.545, respectively, both less than 1. However, when divided by the standard error (SE), the results were -2.94 and 15.1, both absolute values >2, thus refuting the normal distribution hypothesis. The result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test also confirmed that the Z-score distribution refuted the normal distribution hypothesis (Z = 1.532, P = 0.018). In the histogram of Z-score distributions with a centered and superimposed standard normal reference curve (Fig 1a), the histogram of Z-scores calculated using the Leung TN, Pang MW et al equations was clearly skewed to the right.\nUsing the reference equations from Chitty LS, Altman DG et al, a total of 19,588 measurements between 12–42 gestational weeks were transformed into Z-scores. The mean value of the Z-scores was -0.1322, and the SD was 0.8719. Skewness and kurtosis were 0.001 and 0.911, respectively, both less than 1. However, when divided by the standard error (SE), the results were 0.056 and 2.6, the absolute value of the latter was >2, thus refuting the normal distribution hypothesis. The result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test also confirmed this conclusion (Z = 1.989, P = 0.001). The histogram of Z-score distributions calculated using this equation (Fig 1b) seemed to be narrowed compared with the standard normal reference curve.\nFinally, we used the reference equations provided by Papageorghiou AT et al. A total of 19,515 measurements between 14–42 gestational weeks were transformed into Z-scores. The mean value of the Z-scores was 0.5845, and the SD was 1.3923. The skewness and kurtosis were 0.043 and 0.029, respectively, both less than 1. However, when divided by the standard error (SE), the results were 2.38 and 0.83, and the absolute value of the former was >2, thus refuting the normal distribution hypothesis. The result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirmed the same hypothesis (Z = 1.755, P = 0.004). In the histogram of Z-score distributions with a centered and superimposed standard normal reference curve (Fig 1c), the histogram of Z-scores calculated using the equations from Papageorghiou AT et al (2014) seemed to be slightly wider and lower. Are they effective at identifying measurements <5th or >95th percentile?\nFrom the scatter diagram of the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile curves calculated from each superimposed reference chart (Fig 2), we were able to obtain a rough direct impression.

When using the reference equations from Leung TN, Pang MW et al, the observed Z-scores for the 5th percentile and 95th percentile were -0.8983 and 2.6627. A total of 710 measurements that were actually less than the 5th percentile were missed diagnoses, and 3,479 measurements were wrongly classified as larger than the 95th percentile. The sensitivity of screening fetuses with measurements < 5th percentile was only 23.1%, although the specificity was 100%, and the Youden index was 0.231. Thus, the value was too low to be used as a diagnostic test. The sensitivity and specificity of screening for fetuses with measurements >95th percentile were 100% and 80.2%, respectively, and the Youden index was 0.802.\nThe observed Z-scores for the 5th percentile and 95th percentile when using the reference equations from Chitty LS, Altman DG et al were -1.530 and 1.2746. A total of 280 measurements that were actually less than the 5th percentile and 586 measurements that were actually larger than the 95th percentile were missed diagnoses. The sensitivity of screening fetuses with measurements < 5th percentile and > 95th percentile was 72.1% and 39.8%, respectively, and the specificity was 100% for both percentiles. Thus, the Youden index was 0.721 for identifying measurements that were <5th percentile and 0.398 for identifying measurements that were >95th percentile.\nFinally, when using the reference equations from Papageorghiou AT et al (2014), the observed Z-score for the 5th and 95th percentile were -1.6622 and 2.9296. Only 25 measurements were wrongly classified as less than the 5th percentile, and 3,436 measurements were wrongly classified as greater than the 95th percentile. The sensitivity of screening fetuses with measurements < 5th percentile and > 95th percentile were both 100%, and the specificity was 99.9% and 81.5%, respectively. Thus, the Youden index was 0.999 for identifying measurements that were <5th percentile and 0.815 for identifying measurements that were >95th percentile.\nBecause of ethnic heterogeneity, we were initially inclined to believe that reference curves calculated from data from our own nation and ethnic population would be more applicable. Surprisingly, our findings were very different. The Z-score distribution curves of the measurements appeared to be normal, but none of them matched the expected standard normal distribution. The only published reference curve from a Chinese population (Leung TN, Pang MW et al) had very limited diagnostic value in correctly identifying fetuses with short femur length, with a Youden index of only 0.231. In the clinical arena, however, the significance of correctly diagnosing a fetus with a short femur length is much greater than that of identifying a longer FL. Thus, this curve is not the appropriate reference chart for our Chinese population. This may be due to the fact that this curve was calculated from data from one Hong Kong hospital and that hereditary differences may exist between women in that region and women in northern China.The classic reference curve published by Chitty LS, Altman DG et al in 1994 has been widely used. The Youden index for recognizing a FL< the 5th percentile is 0.721. A Youden index of more than 0.7 is generally considered to be a better diagnostic test. Although its diagnostic value for recognizing a FL >5th percentile is lower (Youden index 0.398), we still considered this reference curve to be valuable in the clinical arena.Papageorghiou AT et al published the study of the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project. This was a multi-center, population-based longitudinal study that aroused widespread concern in the obstetrics academic community globally because of its scientific design. Doubts still remain. The data were collected from 8 countries, and we were uncertain about the applicability of the reference curve in our population. We were surprised to discover that this chart had very high sensitivity and specificity for correctly identifying measurements below the 5th percentile and measurements greater than the 95th percentile, with Youden indices of 0.999 and 0.815, respectively. Thus, this reference chart was found to have the best diagnostic value in our study."],"prob":["subject, measur, valu, mean, correl, use, standard"],"frex":["subject, coeffici, deviat, linear, measur, correl, mean"],"lift":["spearman’, 75th, interassay, bland, 25th, percentil, subject"],"score":["subject, measur, valu, correl, coeffici, mean, variabl"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["fig, signific, p, n, group, tabl, differ"],"children":[{"name":["fig, journal.pon, show, decreas, might, chang, observ"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[56],"thought_1":["Descriptive Statistics for the Four Exposures\nFig 2 displays the cytokine concentrations for all days and exposures. There are two distinct groups of subjects as well as individual differences. Seven (subjects 3–9) of the 15 subjects have higher concentrations of IL-1β and IL-10 but lower concentrations of IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-13 and IFN- γ when compared to the rest of the group (subjects 1, 2, 10–15). The results for subject 5 indicate a change from the former group (high levels of IL-1β and IL-10) to the latter group for the DE, O3 and DE+O3 exposures. IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α have higher sustained concentrations across the two days when compared the other seven cytokines. IL-8 and TNF-α do show decreasing Pre-to-Post concentrations for the DE and DE+O3 exposures but not for the O3-only exposure where there is a Pre-to-Post increase in concentration. Individual increases for the O3-only exposure are also evident. Subjects 2, 3, 10, and 11 have increasing IL-8 and TNF-α concentrations following the O3 exposure while subject 15 has decreasing concentrations following exposure. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.g002\nFig 2 Heatmap of the plasma cytokine levels for all exposure treatments over a 24-hour period. The concentrations in Fig 2 increase as the color changes from blue to red. Descriptive statistics (geometric mean and +/- 95% CI) for each exposure and day are shown in Table 2. The “pre” exposure concentrations for each exposure-arm on Day 1(as seen in Table 1) should be similar to one another, this holds true for all cytokines except for IL-1β on the “Pre”, “Clean” exposure. Looking at Fig 2, these results could indicate an artifact caused by the concentration of IL-1β for subject 3, which is ~10pg/mL while the concentrations are ≤1.0pg/mL for the majority of the other subjects. Subject 3 is also part of the group (Subjects 3–9) that has increased levels of IL-1β and IL-10 through all exposures. Looking across all exposures, IL-8 and TNF- α had the highest mean concentrations while IL-2 had the lowest mean concentration. The majority of the cytokine concentrations in each of the DE, O3, and DE+O3 treatments decreased following the respective exposure. The 10 cytokines had pre-exposure geometric means (GMs) for the clean, DE, O3, and DE+O3 exposures of 0.738pg/mL, 0.727pg/mL, 0.862pg/mL, and 0.800pg/mL, respectively, while the “Post” GMs for the clean, DE, O3, and DE+O3 exposures were 0.669pg/mL, 0.668pg/mL, 0.833pg/mL, and 0.740pg/mL. In each case, there was an overall decreasing pre-to-post trend. Exposure Responses–Pre vs. Post vs. Follow-up\nAs discussed earlier, human studies are relegated to environmental levels as experienced by the general public in the real-world. As such, effects (if any) are subtle and require detailed statistical analysis to be generalizable to larger populations. In the following analyses, we show that despite the large variance components observed, there are indeed statistically significant changes observed in the measured inflammatory markers.\nMatched, post-exposure to pre-exposure ratios and follow-up to pre-exposure ratios were created for each exposure and cytokine and displayed in Figs 3 and 4. In Fig 3, a ratio above “1” indicates that the “post” exposure concentration was higher than the “pre” exposure concentration and a ratio below “1” indicates the opposite. In Fig 4, a ratio above “1” indicates that the “follow-up” exposure concentration was higher than the “pre” exposure concentration and a ratio below “1” indicates the opposite. Only statistically significant results are reported below; three (IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-13) of the ten cytokines had no statistically significant Pre-to-Post or Pre-to-FU differences. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.g003\nFig 3 Post/Pre exposure cytokine concentration ratios for the four treatments.\nEach blue “dot” represents an individual Post/Pre cytokine concentration ratio for that respective treatment. A solid line in each of the cytokine scatterplots displays the median post/pre ratio. The dotted line that is anchored at “1” on each y-axis indicates the ratio where the Pre-exposure concentration is equal to the Post-exposure concentration. A statistically significant result above/below “1” indicates that there has been an increase/decrease in the concentration for that respective cytokine at end of the 2-hour exposure period. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.g004\nFig 4 Follow-up/Pre exposure cytokine concentration ratios for the four treatments.\nEach blue “dot” represents an individual Follow-up/Pre cytokine concentration ratio for that respective treatment. A solid line in each of the cytokine scatterplots displays the median follow-up/pre ratio. The dotted line that is anchored at “1” on each y-axis indicates the ratio where the Pre-exposure concentration is equal to the Follow-up concentration. A statistically significant result above “1” indicates that there has been an increase in the concentration for that respective cytokine 22-hours after the end of the 2-hour exposure period. A statistically significant result below “1” indicates that there has been a decrease in the concentration for that respective cytokine 22-hours after the end of the 2-hour exposure period. Given that there was no “exposure” on Day 1 of the clean treatment, minimal Pre-to-Post change was expected following the 2-hour treatment period, but unanticipated results were observed. The two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, had moderate and statistically significant decreases following the treatment, respectively, and IFN-γ, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, also had a statistically significant decrease. The other pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-8, IL-12p70, and TNF-α) had no statistically significant results. IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ all have t-cells as their progenitor cell but IL-2 and TNF-α, the other two cells that can be produced by t-cells, had no statistically significant results. The lack of statistically significant results for IL-5 and IFN-γ in Fig 4 indicates that the cytokine levels return to their “Pre” exposure levels 22-hours after the clean treatment. However, IL-4 switches from a moderate statistically significant Pre-to-Post decrease to a statistically significant 22-hour post treatment increase.\nThe median ratios for the DE exposure all display a Pre-to-Post decrease. Similar to the clean treatment, IL-5 and IFN-γ have statistically significant decreases in cytokine concentration from the “Pre” values to the “Post” values however TNF-α also has a statistically significant decrease. Unlike the clean treatment, there is no noticeable difference between either the pro- or anti-inflammatory classifications or which cell produces the cytokines of interest. There are no statistically significant results for the follow-up comparison (see Fig 4).\nThe post-exposure results for the O3 exposure show that 5/7 cytokines have Post/Pre ratios that are below “1”, with IL-2 having a significant decrease and IL-5, IFN-γ, and TNF-α having moderately significant decreases (see Fig 3). These results are very similar to the DE results from Day 1; the Post/Pre ratios for the majority of the cytokines decrease however there are few statistically significant results. All of the pro-inflammatory cytokines on Day 1 had decreasing median Post/Pre ratios and the two anti-inflammatory cytokines either had no change (IL-4) or exhibited decreasing (IL-5) median Post/Pre ratios. The Follow-up/Pre (Fig 4) ratios are unremarkable and all cytokines, except IL-2, have 22-hour post exposure concentrations that are similar to the Pre exposure concentrations. Like the Pre-to-Post Day 1 decrease, IL-2 still displays a statistically significant decrease in expression following the exposure; the “post” mean for IL-2 (0.169pg/mL) is not statistically different (p = 0.99) than the follow-up mean (0.143pg/mL). The O3 samples also display a greater overall range of individual responses, as evidenced by the increase in scatter across the 7 cytokines.\nDay 1 of the DE+O3 co-exposure had 5/7 cytokines with decreasing median “Pre” to “Post” concentrations following exposure, with four (IL-5, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) having statistically significant decreases (see Fig 3). Three (IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) of these four cytokines are pro-inflammatory cytokines. The other two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2 and IL-8, have increasing “Pre” to “Post” concentrations, though neither is statistically significant. Fig 3 also shows that two (IL-12p70 and TNF-α) of the three cytokines that can be produced by macrophage have significantly decreases. As mentioned above, IL-5, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, also has a statistically significant “Pre” to “Post” decrease. The most striking difference between the DE+O3 co-exposure and the other three treatments are the Follow-up/Pre ratios seen in Table 3. The follow-up samples for IFN-γ and TNF-α are still significantly and moderately significantly less than the Pre exposure samples. However, IL-5 and IL-12p70, the other two cytokines that have significant pre-to-post decreases no longer display this trend. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.t003\nTable 3 Cell count descriptive statistics by exposure and sample time.a Exposure Day\nSample Time\nCell\nClean\nDE\nO3\nDE+O3 1\nPre\n% Lymph\n34.4 (1.53)\n36.1 (1.86)\n34.7 (1.93)\n36.2 (1.67) Pre\nAbs.

The DE exposure shows IFN-γ and TNF-α having statistically significant decreases following exposure. IL-2 and IFN-γ decrease following the O3 exposure, while IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α all decrease following the DE+O3 exposure. Fig 4 shows that the Th1/Th2 “balance” in the DE exposure returns to baseline 22-hours after exposure, but IL-2 is still suppressed in the O3 exposure and IFN-γ and TNF-α are still suppressed in the DE+O3 exposure. In summary, there are more exposure-related effects for the Th1 cytokines. TNF-α\nThe results for TNF-α stand out from the other 6 cytokines for the DE, O3, and DE+O3 exposures. Fig 5 shows that “Post” concentrations for the three exposures are generally less than the “Pre” concentrations for the respective day. The “Post” concentrations for both the DE and O3 exposures are significantly and moderate significantly less than the “Pre” values, for the respective exposures. These two exposures also show that the Follow-up median value is not statistically different from either the “Pre” or “Post” sample from Day 1. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.g005\nFig 5 TNF-α cytokine results for three exposure scenarios.\nThe boxes in Fig 5, above, display the median, upper 75%, and lower 25% of the concentrations for TNF-α, while the bars display the upper 97.5% and the lower 2.5% of the concentrations. This figure shows that the combination of the DE-only and O3-only exposures into a DE+O3 co-exposure creates a suppression of TNF-α that does not recover after a 22-hour period. The DE+O3 graph on the right side of Fig 5 shows that there are an increased number of statistically significant results when compared to the DE and O3 graphs on the left side of the figure. Of particular note, there are no statistically significant results on Day 2 for the DE or O3 exposures, but the combination of these two exposures into the DE+O3 co-exposure produces a statistically significant result on Day 2. The DE+O3 results show that TNF-α is suppressed by the Day 1 exposure and this suppression almost recovers in a 24-hour timeframe. Note that the median for Day 2 is higher than both the Pre and Post median for Day 1, but the moderately significant result still shows an overall pre to follow-up decrease that is similar to the pre to post decrease. Cellular Response and Correlations with Cytokines\nTable 3 displays the white blood cell count results for the four exposures. The three cell types have “Pre” mean concentrations (as seen in the “Abs. Lymph”, “Abs. Mono” and “Abs. PMN” rows) across the four exposures that are very similar to one another (Table 3). The “Pre” means (# cells 103/uL) and standard error (+/- # cells103/uL) for the lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils for the four exposures are 1.93(0.066), 0.555(0.024), and 3.02(0.106). The percentage calculations display this same “Pre” trend as the absolute (Abs.) values. The “Post” WBC values, both differential and absolute, vary based on the respective exposure. The average absolute lymphocyte counts decreased for the clean, DE, and O3 exposures but not for the DE+O3 exposure. The DE and O3 exposures displayed “Pre” to “Post” increases for the monocytes, while the clean and DE+O3 exposures showed average decreases in the absolute monocyte concentrations. All exposures had increasing average PMN concentrations with the DE and DE+O3 exposures having the largest increases.\nThe “Pre” to “Post” differential counts were somewhat different from the absolute concentrations. Changes in the absolute concentrations for some of the WBCs were reflected as a more significant change (and consequently indicated in the statistical tests in Table 4) in the percentage of total WBC calculations. For example, the DE exposure had Pre and Post absolute mean PMN differences of 0.84# cells*103/uL, while the DE+O3 exposure had very similar Pre and Post absolute mean PMN differences of 0.81# cells*103/uL. However, this small difference in absolute mean concentration translated into a Pre to Post percentage PMN increase of 8% for the DE exposure and 9.4% for the DE+O3 exposure. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.t004\nTable 4 Pre, post, and follow-up statistical comparisons by exposure.a Exposure Clean\nDE\nO3\nDE+O3 Pre vs. Post\nPre vs. FU\nPre vs. Post\nPre vs. FU\nPre vs. Post\nPre vs. FU\nPre vs. Post\nPre vs. FU % Lymph\n- (0.0025)\nnone\n- (<0.0001)\nnone\n- (0.0306)\nnone\n- (0.00140)\n- (0.0270) Abs.

Comparing the pre-exposure to post-exposure results shows that the lymphocytes display statistically significant pre-to-post decreases for each of the exposures (see Table 4). The monocytes also have significant pre-to-post decreases but only for the clean and DE+O3 exposures. All four exposures have significant pre to post increases for the neutrophil (PMN) differential counts, but only the DE and DE+O3 display statistically significant absolute count increases. The DE-only exposure has the largest percentage decrease for the lymphocytes while the DE+O3 co-exposure has the largest decrease in percentage for the monocytes and the largest percentage increase in neutrophils.\nUnlike the DE+O3 co-exposure, the clean, DE-only, and O3-only exposures have no significant Pre/Follow-up comparisons. The percentage of lymphocytes in the total WBC count for the DE+O3 exposure is still significantly less than the “pre” exposure percentage 22 hours after the exposure, and the follow-up PMN percentages are still significantly more than the pre exposure percentages.\nGiven the statistically significant results for the DE+O3 co-exposure, correlations between the white blood cells and the cytokines were investigated. Fig 6 shows Spearman correlations between the seven cytokines and the three WBCs. Most of the cytokines and WBCs are highly correlated within themselves across the three time period comparisons (i.e. Pre/Post, Pre/Follow-up, and Post/Follow-up). IL-8 is the only cytokine that does not follow this trend. IL-8 does have negative Pre/Pre and Pre/Post correlations with TNF-α, but no other correlations of importance. 10.1371/journal.pone.0152458.g006\nFig 6 Spearman correlations for pre, post and 22-hour post DE+O3 co-exposure responses.A white dot in a cell indicates a statistically significant (p<0.05) positive or negative correlation.\nLymph = lymphocytes, Mono = monocytes, PMN = polymorphonuclear neutrophil. IFN-γ has negative correlations with IL-4 for all comparisons, an interesting pro- vs. anti- inflammatory result. IL-12p70 also exhibits some negative correlations but with IL-5, the other anti-inflammatory cytokine. The WBCs maintain the same relationships with one another through all comparisons; the neutrophils are negatively correlated with the lymphocytes and the monocytes have no correlations with either the lymphocytes or the neutrophils. The post-exposure neutrophil percentages are positively correlated with the post-exposure IFN-γ concentrations while the post-exposure lymphocytes are negatively correlated with the post-exposure IFN-γ concentrations. There are no post-exposure relationships for TNF-α with either the lymphocytes or the neutrophils, but it is negatively correlated with the post-exposure monocytes. The correlations between the WBCs and IFN-γ do not persist beyond the post/post comparison, but TNF-α does have a negative correlation with the monocyte percentages for the post/follow-up and follow-up/follow-up comparisons.\nTable 3 shows that the mean lymphocytes percentages decrease from Pre to Post. In the same respect, the mean IFN-γ concentrations also display a Pre to Post decrease, however, on an individual basis lymphocyte percentages increase as the IFN-γ concentrations decrease. This is important because the neutrophils are positively correlated with IFN-γ. The relationship is not as strongly correlated (ρ = 0.416 vs. ρ = -0.500 for the IFN-γ/PMN vs. IFN-γ/lymph comparisons, respectively) as the relationship with the lymphocytes, but this example is one of the few described occurrences.\nAs indicated above, this study had two purposes: one, discover short-term effects on the expression of the inflammatory cytokines and white blood cells, and two, investigate if any exposure-related changes persisted for a day. There was no expectation that the clean exposure would affect the expression of the pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) cytokines, but a small increase was expected from the DE-only and O3-only exposures, with a larger increase expected from the DE+O3 co-exposure. There should be little, if any, statistically significant change in the expression of the anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) cytokines for the Day 1 exposures. The expectation for the follow-up results on Day 2 were that any treatment effects from the filtered clean air, DE, or O3 on Day 1 would be negligible 22-hours after the exposure. The combination of DE and O3 should create the greatest potential to still display a treatment effect; the DE+O3 combination could potentially have a synergistic effect as compared to the single DE or O3 exposures and create a greater chance having an increase in both pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines [48,53]. The literature has mixed results for DE exposures, O3 exposures, and any effect these exposure might have on changes in lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils differential and absolute cell counts. As such, there were no pre-conceived Pre/Post/Follow-up exposure hypotheses for these cells.We recall that the different arms of the experiments for each subject were conducted separated by multiple weeks so the incoming inflammatory baseline could have been variable depending on intervening events. Furthermore, we also detected perturbations from the “air exposure” arm of the experiments, which we attribute to changes induced from scripted (exercise) activity. To normalize for these variables, we chose to interpret all data “within” experiment and use the “pre” values as a baseline for each exposure.The heatmap and the descriptive statistics show a heterogeneous effect by the respective treatments for the subjects, as it is evident by the fact that there are two different “groups” of subjects for 6 of the 10 cytokines across all exposures and days. There are also individual results from each exposure, as evidenced by the non-uniform change in the standard error (Table 2) and the range of responses in Figs 3 and 4. These individual changes were expected based on previous research, but the partitioning of the two “groups” was unexpected. The investigation of which personal factors (BMI, age, race, etc.) contribute to this grouping is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is well known that gender can play an important role in the response to environmental contaminants [54]. As such, the differences between male and female responses to the respective exposures were investigated, but the results were inconclusive based on the low number of female participants. All four of the females were in the group with higher concentrations of IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-13 and IFN- γ, (as seen in Fig 2) but there was not enough statistical power to detect a difference between the group of 4 females/4males and the other group of 7 males. In addition, previous research shows genotypic associations (most commonly with GSTM1 +/- status) with proposed differential responses to O3-only exposures [51,55]. 4 of the 9 GSTM1- participants were in the group with the higher concentrations of IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-13 and IFN- γ, but similar to the gender investigation, the results were inconclusive. We note that gender and GSTM-1 status may well be important discriminators for O3, but that these data are only suggestive; there are simply not enough subjects in each of these groups for significant statistical analysis.\nPre, Post and Follow-up Trends\nThe results from the Day 1 analysis are contrary to the expectations. The statistically significant “Pre” to “Post” decreases for IL-5 and IFN-γ for the clean “exposure” were unanticipated. This change is most likely a bi-product of the incremental exercise on the recumbent bike and/or a circadian cycle variation. This may also be attributable to a “training” effect, but is unlikely as the experimental legs were randomized and a few weeks apart. This potential effect from the exercise is also present on Day 1 of the DE and DE+O3 co-exposures, and to some degree the O3 exposure, where IL-5 has a moderately significant “Pre” to “Post” decrease. Given past results, it was also expected that the pro-inflammatory cytokines would increase following the DE-only and O3-only exposures but the majority of the cytokines had “Post” concentrations that were lower than the “Pre” concentrations. Most of these relationships were not statistically significant, but the decreasing trend for the pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines was unexpected.\nUnlike the results from the other three exposures, the Day 1 DE+O3 exposure suppressed both IL-12p70 and TNF-α production. The trend for this type of suppression of an inflammatory response has been seen in DE-only and O3-only exposures, but at higher exposure levels and in different biological media [36,56]. The results in this study are the first time that this type of inflammatory response has been seen for a “mixed” exposure and there are a few hypothetical reasons behind this suppression. IL-12 is primarily produced by macrophages and as such, these cells are the most likely candidates for the production of IL-12 given that this study uses an inhalation exposure. Previous research shows that macrophages phagocytize DE particles (DEP), which then influences inflammation [57–59]. In this study, either the DE+O3 combination is limiting the ability of the macrophages to phagocytize the DEP, or the co-exposure is limiting the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in the epithelial lining of the lung tissue. In either case, the production of IL-12 is limited by the exposure. IL-12 is also known to be precursor and/or stimulating factor for the production TNF-α as well as the recruitment and differentiation of both Th1 and Th2 cells [30]. Thus, the lack of IL-12 expression could play a role in the lack of TNF-α expression as well as some of the other cytokines that have Th cells as their progenitor cell.\nWith a few exceptions, the Day 2 follow-up results are unremarkable when compared to the Day 1 results as most of the cytokines that were influenced by the Day 1 exposure return to their “pre” exposure levels. IL-4 in the clean treatment does display an increase in expression 22-hours after the exposure, which is the opposite of the trend seen on Day 1, but this can most likely be attributed to the exercise. IL-2 in the O3 exposure is still significantly less than the “Pre” sample. This result is one of the few times that this type of suppression has been shown following an O3 exposure. The DE+O3 co-exposure displays the most striking follow-up results with both IFN-γ and TNF-α still being suppressed. The result for IFN-γ is most likely a combination of the exercise effect, as seen in the clean treatment, and the addition of the suppressive nature on the innate immune system from the DE+O3 exposure, which was discussed above for IL-12 and TNF-α. TNF-α\nThe major contrast between the clean “control” and the other three exposures is the change in the expression of TNF-α. This is an expected result as TNF-α is a known pro-inflammatory cytokine and is one of the initial cytokines to be released by macrophages and Th1 cells upon perturbation. However, the statistically significant decreases in TNF-α for the Day 1 DE and DE+O3 exposures were unexpected. Fig 5 shows that the DE exposure has a statistically significant decrease (p<0.0001) in TNF-α following the 2-hour DE exposure but did recover to pre-exposure levels by the time the follow-up samples were taken. The DE+O3 graph on the right side of Fig 5 shows that the “Pre” to “Post” difference is significant (p<0.0003), and there are two moderately significant results for the Pre-to-Follow-up and Post-to-Follow-up comparisons. Given this, the combination of the DE and the O3 seems to have an interaction effect on the exposure and resulting human response, and the direction of the result is an across-the-board significant decrease in TNF-α expression.\nAs mentioned earlier, a few human-based studies have examined the relationship between TNF-α expression and DE or O3 exposure. The results for these studies are mixed with some showing increased expression, a few with decreased expression, and some with no change at all [34–38]. In vivo murine studies have also concluded that O3 exposure can cause a suppression of TNF-α after an acute dosing regimen. Recently, Oakes et al. 2013, showed that male C57B/L6 mice exposed for 3 hours to an inhalation dose of 2 ppm of O3 had a statistical decrease in TNF-α expression when compared to the control [26]. They note that their study, “used a high concentration of O3” but that, “exposure to 2 ppm of O3 in a rodent was shown to be comparable to 0.2 ppm of O3 in a susceptible human subject” [25,26]. The present study has similar exposure metrics (0.3 ppm for 2 hours) and while the DE exposure showed a significant suppression of TNF-α the O3 exposure only showed a moderate suppression. Our results for these two exposures are comparable to the current literature, but no studies that have examined relationship between a DE+O3 co-exposure and TNF-α expression. Here we have shown for the first time that a DE+O3 inhalation co-exposure suppresses the production of TNF-α, and the Day 1 exposure could be a primer for a more involved response on Day 2. White Blood Cells and Correlations\nThe literature has mixed results for the relationship between WBCs and exposures to DE and O3, while to our knowledge there are no DE+O3 co-exposure results. As seen in Table 3, the “Pre” WBC cell count percentages are equivalent across the four exposures but have varying “Post” changes based on the individual exposure. Changes in the pre-exposure to post-exposure WBC percentages following the clean arm can potentially be attributed to the incremental exercise, a similar result to the relationship between the clean arm and the cytokines IL-5 and IFN-γ. There were also Pre vs. Post statistical differences in the DE, O3, and DE+O3 exposures, but the magnitude of the differences increased when comparing the DE and DE+O3 exposures to the clean treatment. The magnitude of this change, when compared to the clean exposure (the other monocyte decrease), indicates that the combination of the DE and O3 are contributory factors. While it could be argued that these relationships are no different than those observed for the clean exposure, the DE+O3 Pre-to-Follow-up comparisons show, for the first time, that there is an exposure effect.\nInterestingly, the percent changes have less statistically significant Pre/Post and Pre/Follow-up comparisons than the absolute cell count comparisons. These differences demonstrate the shifting immune system dynamics at work related for the specific exposures. For example, the DE+O3 exposure has Pre to Post increasing PMN percentages as well as absolute counts, but the absolute lymphocyte counts do not change while the absolute monocyte counts decrease (though not significantly). The percentage decreases for the lymphocytes and monocytes is not due to decreasing overall numbers but the recruitment (and increasing numbers) of PMNs into the peripheral blood following the DE+O3 exposure.\nCorrelations between the WBCs and the cytokines were only investigated for the DE+O3 co-exposure given the lack of statistical relationships between the exposure and the cytokine/WBC expression for the other three treatments. The Post/Post comparison between IFN-γ and the lymphocytes displays a strong negative correlation while the neutrophils display a strong positive correlation with IFN-γ. IFN-γ is primarily produced by lymphocytes and the expectation should be that there is a positive correlation between these two, however we see the opposite. This result could be time-related where perfusion from the site of inflammation for the cytokines into the peripheral blood is most likely delayed compared to the increase/decrease of WBC production. However, there were no other time comparisons (i.e. Pre/Post, Post/Follow-up, etc.) that had statistically significant positive or negative correlations between any of the WBCs and IFN-γ.\nFinally, the Post/Post and Follow-up/Follow-up anti-correlation between the monocytes and TNF-α is opposite of what would be expected; the peripheral monocyte percentages should be positively correlated with the expression of TNF-α. The results from Tables 2 and 3 show that the mean TNF-α concentrations and monocyte percentages decrease following the DE+O3 exposure, but on an individual basis the monocyte counts increase as TNF-α decreases. One conclusion from these results is that there is a time-related explanation similar to that for IFN-γ, however the exposure could also be causing a relative increase in the expression of the monocytes but a relative suppression of TNF-α. While either could be the case, solidifying this association and the relationships between IFN-γ, PMNs, and lymphocytes require further investigation."],"thought_2":["Overall L-strut stress distribution\nThe L-strut model was based on computed tomography (CT) data from 80 patients at our hospital. The same load (0.01 N) was applied to the L-strut. Fig 3 shows the stress distribution in the L-strut model based on the location of the applied load and the percentage contact area between the L-strut and the maxillary crest. The L-strut stress distribution is indicated by several colors. Red and blue indicate the highest and lowest stress levels, respectively. Relatively high stress occurred at point 1 (applied load position), point 2 (L-strut inner corner), and point 3 (contact between maxillary bone and L-strut), as shown in Figs 1B and 3. Green and sky-blue (relatively high stress) appeared in the entire L-strut model, according to the load applied caudally from the keystone area (Fig 3A). In particular, areas of high stress were generated at point 2 (inner corner) and point 3 (contact with maxillary bone) of the L-strut. Therefore, as the load exerted on the nasal dorsum moved from the rhinion to the supratip breakpoint, the distribution of greatest stress on the L-strut changed from the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (PPE) to the inner corner of the L-strut and the inferior part of the caudal strut near the maxillary bone. L-strut stress distribution values increased as the percentage contact area between the L-strut and the maxillary bone decreased, regardless of load condition (Fig 3B). Under these conditions, the stress on the pillar that is connected to the L-strut by the maxillary bone was high. Therefore, the stress at L-strut point 3 increased gradually as the contact area decreased. 10.1371/journal.pone.0153056.g003\nFig 3 L-strut stress distribution.\nRed and blue indicate the highest and lowest stresses, respectively. Relatively high stress occurred at point 1 (applied load), point 2 (L-strut inner corner), and point 3 (contact between maxillary bone and the L-strut). Increased stress on the L-strut occurred as the location of the applied load moved caudally (supratip breakpoint) and the contact percentage decreased. A. Stress distribution according to the location of the applied load. As the applied load increased near the supratip breakpoint, the stress value increased at point 2 and around point 2. B. The stress distribution according to the contact percentage between the L-strut and the maxillary crest. Increased stress occurred in the caudal segment between points 2 and 3 as the contact percentage decreased. Stress analysis at L-strut points 1–3 according to the location of the applied load\nFig 4A–4C shows the maximum stress values at L-strut points 1–3, respectively, according to the location of the load and the contact percentage. The stress generated at point 1 remained similar regardless of the load location and the contact percentage, as shown in Fig 4A. This trend is also evident in Fig 3; the stress at point 1 was relatively constant. The stress at point 2 decreased gradually after increasing, according to changes in the load applied caudally from the rhinion (Fig 4B): the maximum stress was under load locations 5 and 6, regardless of changes in the contact percentage. As the location of the applied load moved from location 1 (rhinion) to location 9 (supratip breakpoint), the stress at point 3 increased, as shown in Fig 4C. The stress values increased slowly from location 1 to location 6, and then increased rapidly under the location 7 and 8 load conditions, with similar values under the location 8 and 9 load conditions. The stress distributions for the location 6 to 9 load conditions are shown in Fig 3. The stress values at points 2 and 3 were determined by the location of the applied load and found to be 2- and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, than the applied pressure (0.01 MPa) when the load was subjected to the dorsum of the L-strut from the supratip breakpoint (superior point of the L-strut inner corner) within a 6 mm cephalic length with 20% contact. 10.1371/journal.pone.0153056.g004\nFig 4 Maximum stress at each point in the L-strut.\nA.

Stress at point 2 decreased gradually after an initial increase, according to changes in the applied load caudally from the rhinion. In particular, the maximum L-strut stress occurred at point 2 under the location 5 and 6 load conditions, regardless of changes in contact percentage. C. The stress at point 3 increased when the location of the applied load was changed from the rhinion to the supratip breakpoint. Maximum stress analysis at L-strut points 2 and 3\nThe effects of the load position and the contact area percentage on stress values at L-strut points 2 and 3, and the maximum stress under each condition, are shown in Fig 5. Stress increased gradually as the applied load neared the caudal position (Fig 5A). The largest stress at points 2 and 3 occurred under the location 6 to 9 load conditions. L-strut stress was dependent on the contact area percentage. Stress values increased steadily at the transition point, while those for contact areas of 45–20% increased rapidly. Stress values, particularly under location 6 to 9 load conditions, steadily increased as the contact percentage decreased from 80–50% and increased rapidly as the contact percentage decreased further to 45–20%. Moreover, the maximum stress values for L-strut points 2 and 3 were 2.5-fold larger than the applied load. Therefore, the L-strut could collapse with contact percentages lower than 45–40%. 10.1371/journal.pone.0153056.g005\nFig 5 Maximum stress values between stress applied at points 2 and 3 according to the location of the applied load and the contact percentage with the maxillary bone.\nA. Three-dimensional graph. B. Two-dimensional graph. Stress values increased gradually as the applied load moved closer to the caudal position. The larger stress values at points 2 and 3 occurred under the location 6–9 load conditions. Stress on the L-strut was dependent on the contact percentage. Stress increased steadily at the later transition point and increased rapidly with contact percentages of 45–20%. Stress values, particularly those under the location 6–9 load conditions, increased rapidly in the 45–20% contact range. Moreover, the maximal L-strut stress values at points 2 and 3 were 2.5-fold larger than that of the applied load. Displacement analysis at L-strut point 2\nDisplacement was recorded as the difference at point 2 (L-strut inner corner) between before and after the load was applied at point 1, as shown in Fig 6. Displacement was measured at point 2 in the Z-axis direction (Fig 2A). The displacement values at point 2 rose steadily according to the caudal load condition; maximum displacement occurred under the location 8 and 9 load conditions (Fig 7B). The rate of increase was consistent under the location 1 to 5 load conditions and rose rapidly under the location 6–9 conditions. Moreover, displacement increased as the contact percentage decreased; displacement with 45–20% contact rose rapidly, as shown in Fig 7B. Maximum displacement occurred with 20% contact. Therefore, the L-strut at point 2 with 45–20% areas of contact was deformed and could collapse at contact percentages lower than 45% under the location 6–9 load conditions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0153056.g006\nFig 6 An explanation of displacement at point 2 (L-strut inner corner).\nThe difference in the point 2 location was measured in the Z-axis direction before and after a load was applied to the dorsal L-strut. 10.1371/journal.pone.0153056.g007\nFig 7 Displacement at point 2.\nA. Displacement values at point 2 rose steadily under the caudal load condition; maximum displacement occurred under the location 8 and 9 load conditions. B. Displacement increased as contact percentage decreased, showing rapid displacement in the 45–20% contact range. Stress and displacement analysis under the 100% contact condition\nThe 100% contact values were extracted from the results in Fig 7 to simulate an actual dorsal augmentation situation. Fig 8A shows the stress distribution results at L-strut points 2 and 3, according to the location of the applied load, under 100% contact. The stress values at point 3 were maximal under the location 8 and 9 load conditions. Stress values at point 2 were higher than those at point 3, and the highest values at point 2 were seen under the location 7 load condition. The displacement distribution at point 2 was also represented in the 100% contact condition, as shown in Fig 8B. As the applied load moved from location 1 to location 9 (from the rhinion caudally), the displacement values increased, and the maximum values were seen under the location 8 and 9 (supratip breakpoint) load conditions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0153056.g008\nFig 8 Results for 100% contact between the caudal L-strut and the maxillary crest.\nA. Stress at points 2 and 3 based on the applied load location. Maximum stress occurred at point 3 under the location 8 and 9 loading conditions; stress values at point 2 were higher than those at point 3, with the highest values seen under the location 7 loading condition. B. Displacement at point 2 according to the applied load location. As the applied load location changed from location 1 to location 9 (from the rhinion caudally), displacement increased, and maximum values were seen under the location 8 and 9 load conditions (supratip breakpoint). We used a FEM simulation to validate the relationship between deformation or possible collapse of the L-strut and the contact percentage/location of an applied load. Complications, such as saddle nose, can occur after septal surgery; however, there has been no report regarding the reasons behind the occurrence of complications, except for anecdotal evidence that relies on individual surgeons’ experience. A 1-cm-wide L-strut is vital for safety and stability during moderate resection of the septal cartilage. Our FEM results indicate that L-strut stress and displacement distributions depending on contact percentage and load conditions can cause severe deformation or collapse of the L-strut.The stress distribution of the entire L-strut area changed according to the location of the applied load and the percentage contact between the L-strut and the maxillary bone. Greater stresses on the L-strut occurred as the applied load moved toward the caudal position (supratip breakpoint) (Fig 3A) and the contact percentage decreased (Fig 3B). Maximum stress on the L-strut was always generated at points 2 and 3, regardless of the applied load position or the contact percentage. As the applied load neared the supratip breakpoint, the stress value increased around point 2. Larger stress values occurred in the caudal segment between points 2 and 3, depending on the decrease in the contact percentage. Moreover, L-strut stress values depended more on a decrease in the contact percentage than on a change in the applied load position.We assumed that all mechanical properties of the cartilage were in the elastic region rather than in the plastic region[2,9,10,12,20]. If the mechanical properties of the cartilage in the plastic region had also been considered, the FEM results would portray actual clinical behavior more accurately. However, the possibility of L-strut collapse was predictable based on the FEM results.In a previous study, we reported that the contact percentage between the L-strut and the maxillary bone is an important factor in collapse of the L-strut; a high possibility of collapse was observed with contact percentages of less than 40%[19]. We concentrated on the effect of contact percentage and subdivided it into 60–40% contact conditions in 5% increments. Larger stress values occurred in the caudal L-strut between points 2 and 3 as the contact percentage decreased from 45 to 20%. Therefore, the possibility of L-strut collapse in the 45–20% contact range was very high, in accordance with the results of our previous study. Compared with the applied stress (0.01 MPa), the stress values at points 2 and 3 were larger, with a rapid increase in the 45–20% contact range, as shown in Fig 4C. The possibility of collapse started to increase at a contact percentage of 45%. Although the position of the transition point changed according to the load location, most transition points among the load conditions were in the 60–40% contact range. The stress values for all load conditions increased at around 50% contact, and stress values increased steeply below 45% contact. Displacement also rose depending on the contact percentage, with the displacement rate increasing with 50–40% contact. Therefore, high deformation energy existed at L-strut point 2, where the stress and displacement values were high. This indicates a high possibility of L-strut collapse in the 45–20% contact range.Moreover, the degree of change in displacement values at point 2 was relatively small under the location 1–4 load conditions, even with a decrease in the contact percentage. However, displacement values under the location 5–9 load conditions rose according to the contact percentage decrease and increased rapidly with 45–20% contact (Fig 7B). Therefore, the stress (between the L-strut and maxillary bone) and displacement values (at point 2) were 2.5- and 2-fold larger, respectively, than the standard load applied under the 20% contact condition. This result indicates that the contact percentage between the L-strut and maxillary bone affects L-strut collapse. The contact percentage between the caudal L-strut and the maxillary crest should be preserved at > 45% at point 3 to prevent collapse of the L-strut.The L-strut stress and displacement distributions changed depending on the location of the load on the nasal dorsum and the contact percentage with the maxillary crest. These changes should be considered as a possible factor in L-strut collapse. Deformation of the L-strut increased as the contact percentage between the caudal L-strut and the maxillary crest decreased. With an L-strut width of 1 cm, the ability of the L-strut to maintain its shape decreased when contact with the maxillary bone was 45%, suggesting that the L-strut would inevitably collapse with a contact percentage of less than 45%.Distortion of the septal cartilage increased when the pressure point changed in the caudal direction of the nasal dorsum. When the applied load was closest to the supratip breakpoint, the stress values at points 2 and 3 increased and the displacement at point 2 increased, as shown in Figs 5B and 7B. The stress values at points 2 and 3 were larger than the applied load under the location 7–9 load conditions (Fig 5B). If the load was applied to the dorsal segment of the L-strut from the supratip breakpoint (superior point of the L-strut inner corner) to within 6 mm cephalically, a 2.5-fold greater stress occurred in the caudal segment of the L-strut around the maxillary bone and the displacement value at point 2 also increased.Fig 8 shows the L-strut stress and displacement distributions at points 2 and 3 with 100% contact, which preserved the caudal portion of the L-strut. As the results in Fig 8 indicate, if load was applied to the dorsal L-strut in the lower half including the supratip breakpoint the stress and displacement values increased, leading to collapse or transformation of the strut. As these results show, excess augmentation in the lower portions of the nasal dorsum is not desirable; the augmentation material should be distributed widely over the rhinion. In addition, these results indicate that the dorsal augmentation graft must be fixed in an augmentation material pocket on the nasal dorsum to prevent downward displacement of the graft material due to gravity and excess pressure on the supratip breakpoint.The follow-up period for dorsal augmentation rhinoplasty is generally short, and aesthetic results tend to focus on comparing before and after images. Our results emphasize the importance of long-term maintenance of the nasal dorsal line following a dorsal implant; thus, long-term follow-up is needed after surgery. In a previous study, we found that grafts are occasionally displaced after dorsal augmentation rhinoplasty. These outcomes may be attributed to disruption of the L-strut. Moreover, many studies have reported results using numerous augmentation materials and methods, but relatively few have described septal cartilage design when comparing dorsal augmentation results[5–8]. Accordingly, we suggest that a description of the septal cartilage design should be required when comparing the safety and cosmetic results of dorsal augmentation methods.The caudal segment of the L-strut must either be preserved perfectly or reinforced with other cartilage during dorsal augmentation. This study is the first step towards provision of patient-customized surgery using FEM. Further scientific development may enable measurements of individual nasal anatomy, which would allow us to predict outcomes in individual patients before surgery. A preoperative FEM simulation may facilitate determination of septal cartilage design and appropriate augmentation material height to provide safe support and good aesthetic results.FEM software is effective in terms of cost and time because it simulates the mechanical behavior of target tissues and organs. The L-strut model used in this study was prepared with linearly elastic mechanical properties, as we assumed the isotropic properties. We also confirmed L-strut stress and displacement distribution behaviors in one direction and the load in the elastic region. The cartilage of the virtual L-strut had anisotropic, viscoelastic, elastic, and plastic mechanical properties, similar to an actual L-strut. The FEM results would be closer to actual clinical behavior if the mechanical properties of the cartilage, such as the viscoelastic and plastic modulus values, could be identified,. In addition, we conducted the L-strut simulation under a unidirectional load; however, the in vivo L-strut is loaded in multiple directions. If a multi-axis load is applied to the L-strut, buckling, deflection, and torsion will occur. Additional studies are needed that include the actual pressure force applied in accordance with the augmentation material (e.g., silicone, Gore-tex, etc.) and the use of realistic septal cartilage configurations. Stress distributions, torsion rates, and moment gradients of the L-strut need to be included in L-strut behavior analyses, using multi-axis loads to simulate actual clinical outcomes.This study was conducted to analyze the septal L-strut without considering any other factors that could influence strut support. Dorsally and caudally, the cartilaginous septum is interconnected with the upper lateral cartilages and lower lateral cartilages, respectively[4]. Thus, to model more realistically the mechanical behavior of the L-strut using FEM, additional studies incorporating boundary conditions from this surrounding environment in the nasal septum are needed."],"prob":["fig, differ, increas, show, observ, chang, journal.pon"],"frex":["fig, journal.pon, show, decreas, might, chang, observ"],"lift":["pronounc, dash, slight, whisker, steeper, notic, slower"],"score":["fig, increas, decreas, journal.pon, tabl, show, chang"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["p, n, vs, group, sd, signific, tabl"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[97],"thought_1":["Patients Patient demographics in the CTNB and non-CTNB groups are summarized in Table 1. There were 124 patients in the CTNB group and 197 patients in the non-CTNB group. The non-CTNB group included 188 patients who underwent bronchoscopic biopsy and 9 who underwent thoracoscopic wedge resections. In the CTNB group, the biopsy specimen was non-diagnostic in 6 patients (5%). These patients were diagnosed intraoperatively by wedge resection, and subsequently underwent lobectomy. 10.1371/journal.pone.0042043.g002 Figure 2 Progression-free survival (PFS) rates in stage I lung cancer patients who underwent computed tomography-guided needle biopsy (CTNB group) versus patients who did not (non-CTNB group). (A) PFS was significantly reduced in the non-CTNB group in comparison to the CTNB group overall (CTNB group, n = 124; non-CTNB group, n = 197; p = 0.04, log-rank test). (B–D) When subgrouped according to tumor size into p-T1a (CTNB group, n = 79; non-CTNB group, n = 78; p = 0.55, log-rank test), pT1b (CTNB group, n = 25; non-CTNB group, n = 51; p = 0.44, log-rank test), or p-T2a (CTNB group, n = 20; non-CTNB group, n = 68; p = 0.36, log-rank test), the differences in PFS became insignificant. The incidence of adenocarcinoma was significantly higher in the CTNB group at 112 (90%), in comparison to the non-CTNB group at 161 (82%) (p = 0.04). Tumor size was significantly larger in the non-CTNB group (25±9 mm) in comparison to the CTNB group (19±9 mm) (p<0.001). The proportion of patients classified as pT1a was significantly higher in the CTNB group (64%) than in the non-CTNB group (40%) (p<0.001). In contrast, the proportion classified as p-T2a was significantly higher in the non-CTNB group (35%) than in the CTNB group (16%) (p<0.001). Regarding the surgical procedures, in the CTNB group, lobectomy was done in 111, and segmentectomy was done in 13 patients. In the non-CTNB group lobectomy was done in 183, bilobectomy was done in 3, and segmentectomy was done in 11 patients. Systematic lymph node sampling was done in all patients. The proportion of lobectomy or more was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.10). Percentages of the microscopic pleural, vascular, or lymphatic invasions were comparable between the two groups. The number of needle punctures in the CTNB group was 1 in 114 patients, 2 in 7, and 3 in 3 patients. As for complications in the CTNB group, pneumothrax developed in 23 out of 124 patients (19%), and mild hemoptysis was seen in 12 out of 124 patients (10%), which all improved without any interventions. Needle-tract recurrences have not been detected so far in this group of patients. Recurrences The follow-up periods in the two groups were comparable; median 45 months (range 11 to 93 months) in the CTNB group and median 42 months (range 3 to 100 months) in the non-CTNB group. Minimum follow-up was 6 months in patients without disease progression. The types of recurrence are summarized in Table 2. The overall proportion of recurrence was significantly higher in the non-CTNB group (35/197, 18%) than in the CTNB group (11/124, 9%) (p = 0.03). The rates of distant recurrences as well as local recurrences were both significantly higher in the non-CTNB group (28/197, 14% and 18/197, 9%, respectively) than in the CTNB group (8/124, 7% and 4/124, 3%, respectively) (p  = 0.03, 0.04, respectively). The pleural recurrences were ipsilateral in all patients. The rate of pleural recurrence tended to be higher in the non-CTNB group (7/197, 4%) than in the CTNB group (1/124, 1%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The rates of pleural recurrences alone were 1% in both groups (1/124 in the CTNB group, and 2/197 in the non-CTNB group, respectively). Pleural Recurrences Kaplan-Meier analysis of pleural-recurrence free interval showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 1). The difference in the proportions of pleural recurrence between the 2 groups was not significant (Table 2). The rates of pleural recurrences were also subgrouped according to tumor size, pT stage, microscopic pleural invasion, and histology (adenocarcinoma versus other histological types) (Table 3). The rates of pleural recurrences or pleural recurrences alone did not differ significantly between the CTNB and non-CTNB groups in any of the subgroups except in the microscopic pleural invasion (-) subgroup in which the recurrence rate was significantly higher in the non-CTNB group. The details of 8 patients with pleural recurrences are individually summarized in Table 4. CTNB was performed only in patient no. 1; the other 7 patients were diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Pleural recurrence alone was seen in patient nos. 1–3. These 3 patients eventually died of local and distant disease progression. Other patients had concomitant distant recurrences. While the pleural recurrence may have been caused by CTNB in patient no.1, it could also have been due to the pleural invasion of the primary tumor. Progression-free Survival Rates Overall PFS was significantly poorer in the non-CTNB group than in the CTNB group (Fig. 2A). the PFS in the CTNB group was not reduced in comparison to the non-CTNB group when patients were subgrouped according to pT stages (Fig. 2B–D). In this particular study, the proportion of pleural recurrence was not significantly increased in the CTNB group in comparison to the non-CTNB groups. The overall proportion of pleural recurrence tended to be higher in the non-CTNB group than in the CTNB group, which was considered to be at least in part due to the larger tumor size in the former than in the latter. Three patients had pleural recurrences alone at first, 1 in the CTNB and 2 in the non-CTNB group. The proportions of pleural recurrences were not higher in the CTNB group in comparison to the non-CTNB group when subgrouped according to tumor size, or pT stage. The proportion of pleural recurrence was significantly higher in the non-CTNB group in the microscopic pleural invasion (-) subgroup. PFS was also not significantly different between the 2 groups when subgrouped by pT stages. These results are different from the previous reports showing increased incidences of pleural recurrences in early-stage lung cancer patients after transthoracic needle biopsies in comparison to other methods of diagnoses [10], [11]. The reason for this difference is not clear. Additionally, one of the previous reports usually conducted needle puncture twice per procedure [11], which may also have increased the rate of pleural recurrence. The incidence of complications was also within the previously reported ranges [13]–[15].A limitation of the present study is that the median follow-up period of 45 months is relatively short in comparison to that of the previously reported studies, which were 60 months [11] and 80 months [10]. This may have resulted in the limited number of events, i.e., pleural recurrences. However, in the study by Matsuguma et al [10], the majority of pleural recurrences had appeared within 36 months of the procedure. We therefore consider that the median follow-up period of 45 months would be acceptable to evaluate the risk of pleural recurrence after CTNB. Currently, the minimum follow-up period in patients who are progression-free is 6 months. Therefore, it is possible that pleural recurrences will occur in this patient group with further follow-up, but in terms of the Kaplan-Meier estimate, the rate of pleural recurrence was not significantly different between the two groups at this point. Another major limitation of the present study is the sample size, and the difference in the potential selection bias between the CTNB and the non-CTNB groups. According to power analysis, assuming from the previous reports that pleural recurrence was approximately 6 times likely to occur in needle-biopsy patients [10], [11], the present study had enough sample size to evaluate this with a power of 80%. The actual difference was approximately 4 times in the present study (1% versus 4%), but still we consider that our study had moderate statistical power to detect this difference. To address the issue of selection bias, propensity score analysis based on a number of factors such as age, sex, tumor size, pathological stage, surgical procedure, observation period, and the presence of pleural invasion was attempted, but the number of events, in this case pleural recurrence, was considered to be too small in this particular study for the analysis to be valid. To this end, further accumulation of data is necessary. Nevertheless, the rate of pleural recurrence per se after CTNB was substantially lower in comparison to the previous reports, 1% in the present study versus 9% [10] and 6% [11], in the previous reports, respectively.Collectively, at present, we do not consider that CTNB increases the risk of pleural recurrence in resectable lung cancer patients. However, it is also true that several case reports have noted cancer cell implantation along the biopsy route [8], [16]–[19]. Since prospective studies to address this issue would be difficult to design, accumulation of data from further retrospective studies will be necessary to clarify this point."],"thought_2":["Changes in seroenzyme levels at different times after return to the plains from short-term exposure to high altitude The serum creatine kinase isoform MB (CK-MB) concentration of test subjects after short-term exposure to high altitude was significantly higher than that of the control subjects.

The differences between the three test subgroups and the differences between each test subgroup and the control group were all significant (P<0.01).

There has been no previous report on the cardiac deadaptation during the high altitude deadaptation process and, there has no been study on the cardiac function deadaptation at return to the plains after short-term high altitude exposure. Heath et al. proposed that as high altitude residents descended to the plains, the abnormal environmental stimulation was removed and these people were no longer subject to health threat [4]–[6]. However, Vogel reported that when high altitude natives (43∼50 years old) entered sea level, the stroke index (SI) of their hearts significantly increased, heart rate significantly decreased, whereas the cardiac index (CI) remained unchanged [7]–[9]. Tei index is a new index evaluating global cardiac function using ultrasonic cardiogram, a.k.a. ventricular myocardial performance index (VMPI), first proposed by Japanese scholar Tei et al. [9] and adopted in clinical application. Tei index is a ratio of the sum of ventricular isovolumic contraction (ICT) and, isovolumic relaxation (IRT) and the ventricular ejection time (ET). The index reflects the global cardiac systolic and diastolic function. Both ICT extending, ET shortening during systolic dysfunction and extending IRT, ET shortening during diastolic dysfunction can cause an increase in Tei index. As Tei index evaluates the global cardiac function of the left ventricle, and is easy to measure and repeat, not influenced by factors including age, heart rate, geometric shape of the ventricle, ventricle systolic and diastolic pressures, it is a more scientific way to measure cardiac function than evaluating the systolic and diastolic functions of the heart alone [10], The ventricular ejection fraction (EF) reflects only the ventricular systolic function under the normal EF circumstances, while Tei index reflects the degree of ventricular diastolic dysfunction. It is more accurate to use left ventricular diastolic function as a sensitive indicator [11], which has been widely used in clinical applications. In recent years some have also calculated Tei index from right ventricular isovolumic contraction time, right ventricular isovolumic relaxation time and right ventricle ejection time to evaluate the systolic and diastolic functions of the right ventricle [12]–[13]. In this study, we found that rapid exposure to high altitude of the plains residents could lead to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and a decrease in left ventricle function, even is the high altitude exposure was only short term; these changes were positively correlated with altitude and degree of altitude stress, i.e. higher altitude and worse altitude reaction led to more severely impaired left ventricle function. We also found the LVEF and LVFS decreased significantly. On the 15th day after return to low altitude, the test subjects' LVEF and LVFS had recovered to the level of control subjects; however, the Tei index of the left and right ventricle had not, indicating a low global cardiac function at that time point. Our results suggest that cardiac deadaptation process exists in population returning to the plains after short-term exposure to high altitude; in particular, the recovery of the left and right ventricle function is slow and it may still be in the deadaptation condition 15 days after return to low altitude, which needs to be attended to clinically.Many factors may influence the systolic and diastolic function of the right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery pressure is the most important one. It is well known that alveolar hypoxia is a direct trigger of pulmonary vessel contraction.In this study, we found that exposure to high altitude could quickly increase the vascular contracting factors and decrease the vascular relaxing factors in the plasma, after subjects return to the plains from high altitude, vascular contracting factor ET-1 release gradually decreases and vascular diastolic factor NO release gradually increases, both recover to normal level as the in the control subjects 15 days after the return to low altitude. ET-1 is the most potent internal vascular contracting factor currently known and lungs are the most important organ for the function and metabolism of ET-1 [14]. Under hypoxia the endothelial cells in the lung tissue are damaged and ET-1 gene expression is up-regulated; as the serum ET-1 concentration increases, ET-1 combines ETAR on the pulmonary vascular smooth muscles and causes opening of Ca2+ channels and increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which leads to contraction of pulmonary vessels and increase in pulmonary artery pressure [15]. Selective ET-1-A antagonist can inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vessel contraction, inhibit or decrease pulmonary hypertension under hypoxia [16], through which hypoxia can regulate ET-1 gene expression via inducing HIF-1α and ET-1 levels were linearly correlated with pulmonary artery pressure. After the subjects returned to low altitude, HIF-1α and ET-1 release gradually decreased, and recovered to normal control levels in 15 days after return to low altitude. HIF -1α is an important protein regulatory factor produced by the body under hypoxia, which can regulates many target genes [17]–[18], including ET-1 and NO. Our study found that HIF -1α level is positively correlated with mPAP significantly. Therefore, changes in HIF-1α level caused by hypoxia may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension [19]. 8-iso-PGF2α is a recently discovered biologically active prostaglandin-like substance. Romero et al. [20] found that 8-iso-PGF2α had strong effect in vessel contraction and antinatriuresis; it was involved in generation of high blood pressure even when Ang II level was normal. In addition, the 8-iso-PGF2α concentration in the body fluid is very stable, hence it has been considered the most ideal biochemical index for evaluating free radical oxidation intensity in living bodies [21]–[22]. Our study found that 8-iso-PGF2α level is positively correlated with mPAP significantly. Therefore hypoxia induced serum 8-iso- PGF2α level increase also plays an important role in the generation of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Increase in pulmonary artery pressure adds to the load on right ventricle; decrease in pulmonary artery pressure alleviates the pressure load on right ventricle and facilitates the recovery of right ventricle. Therefore, 8-iso-PGF2α level on right ventricular function has a direct influence.Our results showed that exposure to high altitude led to myocardial damage; the myocardial enzyme activities increased. Upon return to the plains from high altitude, myocardial enzyme CK-MB and LDH-1 activities dropped quickly, and returned to normal control level in 15 days. Upon return to the plains from high altitude, LVEF and LVFS increased quickly, and recovered to normal control level in 15 days after return to low altitude. However, on the 15th day after return, the Tei index that indicates cardiac function still remained high. In particular, acute hypoxia could cause cardiomyocyte membrane damage, leading to decrease in membrane fluidity and increase in membrane permeability [23], which led to outflow of CK-MB and LDH-1 and further aggravated myocardial damages. In addition, hypoxia could also lead to increase in generation of oxygen free radicals, which could further impair cardiac muscles. It is known that oxygen free radicals can lead to oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid in the cell membrane, inactivation of intracellular enzymes and cell membrane rupture, causing severe damages to tissues and cells [24]. Our study also found that exposure to high altitude could lead to increase in serum MDA level and decrease in SOD level; the magnitude of the changes paralleled the degree of high altitude reaction: more severe high altitude reaction led to more increase of MDA level. When subjects returned to low altitude, the MDA activity decreased and SOD level increased, both having recovered to normal control level on the 15th days after the return to low altitude. It is thus evident that after return to the plains, the oxidative damage is alleviated and the antioxidative ability is increased, which leads to more removal of oxygen free radicals in the organism and restored oxidation-antioxidation balance.In conclusion, hypoxia at high altitude can lead to increase in pulmonary artery pressure and decrease in global cardiac function at rapid exposure high altitude, which involves disturbed balance of plasma systolic and diastolic factor release and damage to the cardiac muscles. Damages to the cardiac structure and function caused by short-term rapid exposure to high altitude are reversible. When individuals return to the plains, the myocardial damages can quickly recover and the cardiac function quickly restores to normal control level in about half a month; however, full recovery of global ventricle function takes longer time. During the recovery period, one should protect cardiac muscles, avoid overtiredness and infection, in order to prevent aggravating myocardial damages which may cause high altitude deadaptation

Mutant SOD1 immunoreactivy in the mutant SOD1-Tg, the wild-type SOD1-Tg, and non-Tg wild-type mice In mutant SOD1-Tg mice, C4F6 immunoreactivity was observed in the remaining anterior horn cells with cytoplasmic inclusions (Figure 4A). Immunoreactivity for C4F6 was restricted to the glial cells that were morphologically consistent with microglia in wild-type SOD1-Tg mice (Figure 4B) and absent in non-Tg wild-type mice (Figure 4C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020427.g004 Figure 4 Neuronal inclusions immunopositive for C4F6 in mice. Strong immunoreactivity for C4F6 (A) was observed in the somatodendritic compartment with cytoplasmic inclusions in the mutant SOD1-Tg mice. Immunoreactivity for C4F6 was restricted to glial cells morphologically consistent with microglia in the wild-type SOD1-Tg mice (B) and absent in the non-Tg wild-type mice (C). Bar indicates 50 µm. 14-3-3 immunoreactivity in the mutant SOD1-Tg, the wild-type SOD1-Tg, and non-Tg wild-type mice Pan 14-3-3, 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ immunoreactivities were grossly different between the mutant SOD1-Tg and the wild-type SOD1-Tg or non-Tg wild-type mice (Figure 5). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020427.g005 Figure 5 Neuronal inclusions immunopositive for pan 14-3-3, 14-3-3β, and 14-3-3γ in the spinal cord of SOD1-Tg mice. In mutant SOD1-Tg mice, strong immunoreactivity for pan 14-3-3 (A), 14-3-3β (D), and 14-3-3γ (G) were observed in the neuronal cytoplasm or neuronal process of the lumbar anterior horn cells. Such immunoreactivities were not observed in the wild-type SOD1-Tg (B, E, H) or non-Tg wild-type mice (C, F, I). Bar indicates 50 µm. Such 14-3-3 immunoreactivities were strong in most of the remaining anterior horn cells of the mutant SOD1-Tg mice (Figure 5A, D, G), although they were not observed in the wild-type SOD1-Tg (Figure 5B, E, H) or non-Tg wild-type mice (Figure 5C, F, I). Double immunofluorescent staining of C4F6 and 14-3-3β or 14-3-3γ in SOD1-Tg mice As described above, the strong immunoreactivity of 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ were observed in the mutant SOD1-Tg mice but not in the wild-type SOD1-Tg mice. Wherein, the distribution of immunoreactivity for C4F6, 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ was analyzed. All the three immunoreactivities were observed in the neuronal somata of the anterior horn cells. Furthermore, double immunofluorescent staining showed that both 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ were partially co-localized with C4F6 in mutant SOD1-Tg mice (Figure 6). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020427.g006 Figure 6 Neuronal inclusions double-positive for C4F6 and 14-3-3 in the spinal cord of mutant SOD1-Tg mice. Immunofluorescence for C4F6 (A, D, green), 14-3-3β (B, red), and 14-3-3γ (E, red), double immunofluorescence for C4F6 and 14-3-3β (C, merge), and double immunofluorescence for C4F6 and 14-3-3γ (F, merge) are shown in the anterior horn cells. Bar indicates 20 µm. In negative immunohistochemical controls, some sections were incubated with the primary antibody (0.2 µg/ml) preabsorbed with an excess amount of the antigenic peptides, pan 14-3-3, 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ (10 µg/ml). No specific immunopositive staining was detected in these control sections. Other 14-3-3 isoforms in the mutant SOD1-Tg mice and the wild-type SOD1-Tg mice Immunoreactivitiy for 14-3-3ε, η, θ, σ, and ζ was observed in the neuronal somata and processes in the spinal cord. However, there were no remarkable differences in the distribution or intensity of the immunoreactivities between the mutant SOD1-Tg and wild-type SOD1-Tg mice. In this study, LBHIs in all FALS cases showed intense pan 14-3-3, 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ immunoreactivities. Furthermore, the double immunofluorescent study showed 14-3-3 proteins were co-localized with SOD1 in LBHIs. Such distribution patterns were quite similar to those of the mutant SOD1-Tg mice. This is the first report that demonstrates a close relationship between 14-3-3 and SOD1 both in patients with FALS and mutant SOD1-Tg mice.We have previously reported the localization of 14-3-3 proteins in the ubiquitinated intraneuronal inclusions in the anterior horn cells from patients with sporadic ALS [12]. We also already reported 14-3-3 immunoreactivity in the LBHIs in the anterior horn cells from a patient with FALS, with a two-base pair deletion in the SOD1 gene [19]; however, the co-localization of SOD1 and 14-3-3 was not assessed. Therefore the role of 14-3-3 proteins in LBHI formation with a SOD1 mutation has remained unclear. The co-localization of 14-3-3 and SOD1 in the LBHIs in both FALS patients and mutant SOD1-Tg mice suggested that 14-3-3 may play an important role in the formation of SOD1-containing LBHIs. The similar 14-3-3 positivity in the LBHI of sporadic ALS and FALS with SOD1 mutation further suggests that 14-3-3 is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS, irrespective of whether it is sporadic or familial.Among the various isoforms of 14-3-3 protein, Kaneko and Hachiya proposed the possibility that a distinctive function of 14-3-3ζ might be as a sweeper for misfolded proteins, such as aggregates or inclusion bodies [20]. Santpere et al. suggested that the 14-3-3γ and 14-3-3ζ isoforms may be the targets of oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease [21], and some neurofibrillary tangles were reported to be immunolabeled with 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ [22]. Similarly, 14-3-3 proteins have been co-localized in Lewy bodies [23] and in glial cytoplasmic inclusions from patients with multiple system atrophy [24]. In our recent study, 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ were strongly expressed in the neuronal somata and processes of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord of mutant human α-synuclein (A53T)-Tg mice, an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) [25]. Therefore, 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ may be the key isoforms associated with the formation of α-synuclein- and SOD1-containing inclusions. This raises the possibility that there might be a common mechanism for inclusion formation at least between ALS and PD.An insufficient function of the molecular chaperones may be directly involved in the loss of motor neurons in ALS [26], [27]. Under non-pathological conditions, 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in signal transduction, apoptotic cell death and cell cycle control. 14-3-3 proteins inhibit apoptosis by binding to and inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins, including the mitochondrial Bcl-2 family member BAD, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and the Forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 [10]. Therefore, the sequestration of 14-3-3 may cause neuronal dysfunction and thus contribute to cell death. Strong immunoreactivity for 14-3-3 in the LBHIs of FALS patients and in the mutant SOD1-Tg mice suggested that 14-3-3 proteins are trapped in the LBHIs, and this deficiency of the 14-3-3 proteins causes motor neuronal death in patient with FALS."],"thought_2":["Western blotting\nTo examine the specificity of the rabbit anti-PS antibody, its reactivity was compared with the specificity of rabbit anti-saposin B and D antibodies using immunoblotting. Two bands were detected upon immunoblotting with the anti-saposin B and D antibodies (Fig. 1a,b). These bands were identified using markers, and the upper band was approximately 69 kDa, the molecular size of PS. These results agree with a previous report [18], [39]. The faint lower band was approximately 50 kDa and likely trisaposin. In contrast, only a single band was observed upon immunoblotting with the anti-PS antibody (Fig. 1c) and was identified as PS.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g001Figure 1\nWestern blot of hippocampal protein extracts.\nStained with anti-saposin B (a) and D (b) antibodies. Two bands of approximately 50 kDa and 69 kDa (PS) were detected. (c) Stained with the specific anti-PS antibody. Only one band of PS was detected. Our immunoblotting results show that the rabbit anti-PS antibody used in this study specifically recognizes PS and does not recognize di- or trisaposin. Therefore, the specificity of the anti-PS antibody was demonstrated. PS and PSA-NCAM triple-immunofluorescence staining\nIn neurons from the dentate gyrus at P3 and P7, we observed stronger PS immunoreactivity at P14 (Fig. 2a–d ). Immunoreactivity was observed both in the cytoplasm and nuclei at P3 (Fig. 2a) and P7 (Fig. 2b), but was predominantly cytoplasmic after P14 (Fig. 2c,d ). The immunoreactivities decreased after P14 because the nuclei were enlarged and the cytoplasm was relatively decreased (Fig. 2c,d ). PS-single positive cells were observed in the outer granule cell layer and CA4 region, but not in the SGZ at P28 (Fig. 2d,l ).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g002Figure 2\nFluorescent immunoreactivity of PS and PSA-NCAM.\nFluorescent micrographs of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus showing immunoreactivity of PS (red, a–d ), PSA-NCAM (green, e–h), and their merge (i–l ) at P3 (a,e,i), P7 (b,f,j ), P14 (c,g,k), and P28 (d,h,l ). Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Note that some double-positive cells were observed at P14 (k), and prosaposin-negative and PSA-NCAM-positive neurons clearly localized in the SGZ at P28 (d,h,l ). A low power image of dentate gyrus double-stained with PSA-NCAM and PS at P28 is shown in panel m. MOL: molecular layer, GCL: ganglion cell layer, SGZ: subgranular zone. PSA-NCAM immunoreactivity was clearly observed in the cytoplasm and dendrites (Fig. 2e–h). The staining was diffuse throughout all layers of the dentate gyrus at P3 (Fig. 2e), but was localized to the SGZ after P7 (Fig. 2f–h). These data indicate that neuronal proliferation actively occurs in all layers of the dentate gyrus at P3, but is restricted to the SGZ in adult animals.\nBased on the localization of PS-single positive cells in the outer granule cell layer (Fig. 2d) and PSA-NCAM-single positive cells in the SGZ (Fig. 2h), the single positive cells showed completely complementary distribution (Fig. 2l,m).\nA few double-positive cells were observed at P7 (Fig. 2j ) and some were also found at P14 (Fig. 2k). However, double-positive cells were rarely detected at P28 (Fig. 2l ). Figure 2k and l show PSA-NCAM-positive cells in the SGZ extending their dendrites to the granule cell layer with PS-positive cells. A low power image of the dentate gyrus double-stained with PSA-NCAM and PS at P28 is shown in Figure 2m. PS and NeuN triple immunofluorescence\nThe results of prosaposin immunofluorescence (Fig. 3a–d ) were similar to those in Figure 2a–d; however, its localization in the nuclei was more prominent at P3 (Fig. 3a,e,i ). NeuN expresses in differentiated neurons, and NeuN immunoreactivity was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The granule cell layers at P3 and P7 were thinner (Fig. 3e,f ) than at P14 (Fig. 3g,h).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g003Figure 3\nFluorescent immunoreactivity of PS and NeuN.\nFluorescent micrographs of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus showing immunoreactivity of PS (red, a–d ), NeuN (green, e-h), and their merge (i–l ) at P3 (a, e, i ), P7 (b, f, j ), P14 (c, g, k), and P28 (d, h ,l ). Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). A low-power image of the dentate gyrus double-stained with NeuN and PS at P28 is shown in panel m. Note that the majority of prosaposin-positive neurons are also NeuN-positive at all stages. Double-positive cells were widely observed in all sections. Only DAPI-positive, PS-, and NeuN-double negative cells were observed in the SGZ (Fig. 3i–l ). A low power image of the dentate gyrus double-stained with NeuN and PS at P28 is shown in Figure 3m. Saposin B and PSA-NCAM double immunofluorescence\nSaposin B immunoreactivity is frequently detected in PSA-NCAM-positive cells in the SGZ where PS immunoreactivity is rarely observed (Fig. 4a,b). The double staining is not caused by overlapping cells but rather the co-localization of saposin B and PSA-NCAM in one cell because these photographs were taken using a confocal microscope with a focal depth of 1 µm.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g004Figure 4\nFluorescent immunoreactivity of saposin B and PSA-NCAM.\nLight micrographs of the SGZ in the dentate gyrus at P28 stained with saposin B (red), PSA-NCAM (green) and DAPI (blue). Note that saposin B immunoreactivity (arrows) is frequently detected in PSA-NCAM-positive cells, where PS immunoreactivity is rarely observed. Immunoreactivity of PS in the nuclei and cytoplasm\nLaser microscopy images at higher magnification (Fig. 5) were examined for PS immunoreactivity in the nuclei and cytoplasm at P1, P7, P14 and P21. The results showed PS localization in the apical cytoplasm of granule cells at all stages and in the nuclei at P1, P7 and P14, but not at p21. PS immunoreactivity in the nuclei was found mainly in the dispersed chromatin (euchromatin), but not in the condensed chromatin (heterochromatin) at all stages (Fig. 5).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g005Figure 5\nFluorescent immunoreactivity of prosaposin (PS), microtubule-associated protein (Map-II) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\nFluorescent micrographs of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus show immunoreactivity of PS (red), Map-II (green) and DAPI (blue) at postnatal day (P)1 (a, b), P7 (c, d ), P14 (e, f ) and P21 (g, k). Note that a number of nuclei (asterisks) at P1, P7 and P14 contain PS immunoreactivity, but those at P21 contain only background levels of immunoreactivity (k). In situ hybridization assays\nPro+0, Pro+9 and total PS expression levels in the dentate gyrus were assessed in P7, P14 and P21 animals. HE counterstaining revealed that the dentate gyrus thickness increased with developmental stage progression in rat (Fig. 6 a–l ). As comparison of image analyses among the stages was difficult, we compared the hybridization signal intensities among the sections in the same stage treated with different probes. All sections without HE counterstaining (Fig. 6 m–u) showed greater expression of Pro+9 mRNA than Pro+0 mRNA (Fig. 6 v–x). Higher-magnification images with HE counterstaining revealed that neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) showed weak Pro+9 expression at P21, in agreement with PS immunoreactivity. The highest Pro+9 mRNA expression was observed in CA4 neurons in the hilus, and moderate signals were observed in a number of interneurons in the molecular layer (Fig. 7).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g006Figure 6\nDevelopmental changes in Pro+0 and Pro+9 mRNA levels.\nExpression of total (Pro+0 and Pro+9) mRNA (a–c, m–o, using probe PS-AS1), Pro+0 mRNA (d–f, p–r, using probe PS-AS4), Pro+9 mRNA (g–i, s–u, using probe PS-AS3) and negative control (j–l, using probe S1) in the dentate gyrus at P7 (a, d, g, j, m, p, s, v), P14 (b, e, h, k, n, q, t) and P21 (c, f, I, l, o, r, u, x).

Neurons (arrowheads) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) show lower staining levels of Pro+9 mRNA expression compared with neurons in the granule cell layer (GCL). Neurons in the hilus show intense staining of Pro+9 mRNA expression. A number of neurons (arrows) in the molecular layer (MOL) also show moderate mRNA expression levels.\nThis study investigated PS expression in mature and immature hippocampal granule cells using double immunohistochemistry using antibodies against PS and PSA-NCAM (a marker of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus) or against PS and NeuN (a marker of mature neurons).Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of the secretory type (Pro+9) or lysosomal type (Pro+0) of PS mRNA in the developing dentate gyrus from P3 to P21.To illustrate our results, the development of PS-positive neurons at each stage is summarized in a scheme shown in Figure 8a–d. PS immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus decreases as the animal ages. This may be explained by the disappearance of PS immunoreactivity from the nuclei after P14, the relative decrease in the cytoplasm of mature granule cells with expanded nuclei such that weaker immunoreactivity occurs because PS mainly exists in the cytoplasm, or because PS immunoreactivity is stronger in immature granule cell cytoplasm than mature granule cells (Fig. 8a,b). In fact, PS immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm and nuclei in these younger neurons was strong (Figs. 2a,b, 2a,b, 5).10.1371/journal.pone.0095883.g008Figure 8\nA scheme showing PS expression.\nA scheme showing the stages of neurogenesis and the expression pattern of PS and PSA-NCAM in the dentate gyrus at P3 (a), P7 (b), P14 (c), and P28 (d). Arrows indicate putative paracrine secretion of PS.\nNeuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus was not complete at P7, and PS was synthesized in immature granule cells at this time (Figs. 2b, 3b). After P14, PS was expressed at low levels in immature (PSA-NCAM-positive, NeuN-negative) granule cells (Figs. 2k, 3k), but mature granule cells and interneurons had strong PS immunoreactivity (Figs. 2l, 3l ). Thus, immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young animals highly express PS, but those in adult animals do not express PS. Furthermore, many immature neurons at P3 and P7 contained PS in their nuclei (Figs. 2a,b, 3a,b, 8a), and no PS expression was observed in the nuclei of mature or immature neurons in the adult animals. PS plays a significant role in development via its involvement in signal transduction pathways, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in cells of non-neurological origin [26]. Sun et al. reported that exogenous PS is predominantly localized in the nucleus of cultured cells [42], and our results show that endogenous PS also enters the nucleus under certain conditions.PSA-NCAM-positive cells predominantly exist in the SGZ, the basal side of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, but PS-positive cells localize to the apical side of the granule cell layer at P28. This study shows that most PS-positive cells in the dentate gyrus at P28 are NeuN-positive mature neurons. Double-positive neurons were rarely observed in the SGZ at P28. PSA-NCAM-positive cells in the SGZ extend their dendrites through the granule cell layer composed of many PS-positive neurons (Figs. 2k,l, 8d ).Yokota et al. and Hiraiwa et al. reported a significant increase in PS mRNA after a transient focal cerebral ischemia [16], [49], suggesting a pivotal role for PS in the survival of injured neurons. The PS isoforms Pro+9 and Pro+0 are caused by differential splicing at a splicing site in the saposin B domain [17]. Pro+9 has a 9-base (CAG GAT CAG: Gln Asp Gln) insertion whereas Pro+0 does not. Pro+0 is mainly transported into lysosomes, but Pro+9 is predominantly secreted out of a cell [25]. In addition, their expression pattern is specific in humans, mice, and rats [16], [51]. Pro+0 is mainly expressed in the lung, kidney, and liver, whereas Pro+9 is expressed in the brain, and skeletal and cardiac muscle [51]. The ratio of the two is typically 85∶15 of Pro+9:Pro+0; however, after brain injury, the ratio changes to 95∶5, and Pro+9 was reported to maintain expression throughout the injury [7], [16]. Pro+9 in the brains of chicken and mice increases during process of embryonic development [5]. However, the exact relationship between Pro+9 and the brain remains unknown.Here, we analyzed the expression of both types of PS mRNA in the dentate gyrus after birth. The expression pattern of Pro+0 mRNA at P7, P14, and P21 was similar, but expression of Pro+9 mRNA independently increased at P21 (Fig. 6i ). Pro+9, the secretion type of PS, is produced by mature granule cells but not by immature cells in the SGZ (Fig. 6g–i ). These results suggest that PS is secreted in a paracrine manner from mature granule cells toward developing neural stem cells in the SGZ and plays an important role in neuronal proliferation or differentiation, such as dendrite expansion (Fig. 8c,d ). Indeed, administration of PS or a small peptide mimicking the neurotrophic activity domain of PS is reported to facilitate neurite outgrowth [3] as well as prevent apoptosis [12], [21], [35].At P28, saposin B immunoreactivity was detected in a number of PCA-NCAM-positive cells in which PS immunoreactivity was rarely observed (Fig. 5). Furthermore, PS mRNA expression was minimal in the SGZ in rats at similar stages (Figs. 6, 7). These results suggested that PSA-NCAM-positive immature neurons in the SGZ uptake PS by endocytosis and degrade PS into saposins A–D. By this mechanism, PS might stimulate the growth of dendrites and axons [30], [48], thereby influencing network formation. However, antibodies and hybridization probes are inherently different, and so these results must be interpreted carefully.PS is both a precursor of sphingolipid hydrolase activators and a neurotrophic factor. In fact, a 12-amino acid neurotrophic activity domain was identified in the N-terminal portion of saposin C [30]. The neurotrophic activities of the peptide encompassing this domain have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro [12], [21], [30], [35], [44]. However, the alternate splicing site of PS is located in the saposin B domain, which generates different forms of PS. Lamontagne and Potier reported that saposin B derived from both Pro+9 mRNA and Pro+0 mRNA differed in binding affinity for GM1 ganglioside, sulfatide, and sphingomyelin [23]. However, subsequent research found no significant functional differences in terms of lysosomal hydrolase activation between these saposin B isoforms [14]. Thus, the functional significance of PS isoforms remains unclear, but the tissue-specific expression of each mRNA type has been documented. We observed expression of both alternative splicing forms in the dentate gyrus with increased expression of Pro+9 mRNA in the granule cell layer and constant expression of Pro+0 mRNA, suggesting that the saposin B domain plays an important role in development of nervous tissue, and that proliferation and differentiation are regulated by both splicing forms of PS mRNA. These results also imply that PS has diverse neurotrophic functions in neurogenesis in young or adult animals.Neurons in the brain are not thought to regenerate if they are injured. Many studies associated with neurogenesis are being undertaken worldwide in an effort to challenge this established theory and overcome serious clinical effects. PS has neurotrophic activity and may be related to neurogenesis. The dentate gyrus is part of the hippocampus that is involved in memory and learning; therefore, neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is thought to be related to memory. This study may provide data regarding treatment for diseases related with memory loss."],"prob":["fig, figur, b, c, show, d, stain"],"frex":["3a, 2c, bar, 2b, 3b, 4b, 3c"],"lift":["d-f, e-h, 3f, g-i, 3i, 5a-b, f-h"],"score":["fig, stain, figur, b, c, d, bar"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["lps, tlr4, tlr2, lps-induc, pge2, pretreat, tlr9"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[98],"thought_1":["Differential activation of Syk by TLR7/9 and RR agonists\nTo investigate the role of Syk in signaling triggered in primary pDCs by TLR7/9 and RR, we compared the kinetics of phosphorylation of Syk induced by agonists of both receptors. As in our previous studies, the insufficient quantities of primary pDCs available for biochemical analyses led us to employ dynamic phosphoflow cytometry [13, 16]. Our results show that triggering of TLR9 and RR signaling differentially induced kinetics of Syk phosphorylation (Fig 1A). TLR9 agonist CpG-A induced phosphorylation of Syk, which gradually increased for 30 min and then decreased to the initial MFI value. In contrast, triggering of RR by crosslinking of BDCA-2 induced rapid phosphorylation of Syk that peaked within 10 min of activation and then decreased during the next 50 min. 10.1371/journal.pone.0156063.g001\nFig 1 Phosphorylation of Syk in pDCs stimulated by CpG-A or crosslinked with BDCA-2 mAb.\n(A) Kinetics of phosphorylation of Syk (Y525/526) in the populations of magnetic bead-sorted pDCs exposed to CpG-A or crosslinked with BDCA-2 mAb was followed by flow cytometry (Phosphoflow).

To facilitate biochemical analyses of cell signaling, which is still difficult to perform in rare and in vitro short living human primary pDCs, we performed our studies in human pDC line GEN2.2, which shares many features with human primary pDCs [14]. First, we compared the kinetics of the total phosphorylation of Syk by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with anti-Tyr Ab followed by blotting of immunoprecipitate with Syk mAb (Fig 1B). As in the primary pDCs, triggering of TLR9 and RR signaling in GEN2.2 cells induced differential kinetics of Syk phosphorylation. While after stimulation with CpG-A, total phosphorylation of Syk gradually increased up to 10 min, after stimulation with BDCA-2 mAb, the total phosphorylation of Syk peaked at 2 min.\nWhen cytoplasmic fraction of GEN2.2 cells was probed for phosphorylation of the Syk at Y352 or Y525/526 (Fig 1C), the kinetics of phosphorylation was qualitatively similar to that in primary pDCs and to that of the total Syk phosphorylation in GEN2.2; it gradually increased after stimulation with CpG-A and peaked 2 min after stimulation with BDCA-2 (Fig 1D). While the phosphorylation at Y352, resembled that of the total Syk phosphorylation, the phosphorylation at Y525/526 showed much greater enhancement. In contrast to the total Syk phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of Syk at Y525/526 was more pronounced after stimulation with BDCA-2 than after stimulation with CpG-A, as in primary pDCs (Fig 1A). This result validates GEN2.2 cell line as an appropriate model for the study of cell signaling in pDCs.\nThe phosphorylation at Y525/526 in the kinase domain of Syk was sensitive to the Syk inhibitor AB8779 (Fig 1D and 1E), which is highly selective compared to Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, R406 (S1 Fig and S1 Table). Densitometric analysis revealed that the inhibitory index defined by the ratio of pSykY525/526 determined in the absence and the presence of AB8779 ([pSykY525/526]/[pSyk525/526AB8779]) reached higher values in BDCA-2 (between 2.1 to 3.0) than in CpG-A-stimulated cells (between 1.5 to 2.1) (Fig 1E). This different effect of inhibitor on the phosphorylation induced by CpG-A and BDCA-2 was not observed for Y352. Taken together, triggering of TLR9 and RR induces differential activation of Syk with a differential sensitivity to AB8779. Syk inhibitor blocks TLR7/9-mediated production of IFN-α and proinflammatory cytokines\nWe then investigated the effect of AB8779 on cytokine production in GEN2.2 cells stimulated with TLR9 agonists CpG-A and CpG-B, and with protein kinase (PKC) agonist PMA (Fig 2A). AB8779 inhibited IFN-α production with IC50,CpG-A = 0.117 μM and IC50,CpG-B = 0.215 μM, TNF-α production with IC50,CpG-A = 0.006 μM and IC50,CpG-B = 0.058 μM and IL-6 production with IC50,CpG-A = 0.023 μM, and IC50,CpG-B = 0.021 μM (Fig 2B). In the same experiments, AB8779 only weakly inhibited production of TNF-α induced by PMA, which does not stimulate IFN-α and IL-6 production. In addition, we investigated effect of AB8779 on cytokine production in primary pDCs from healthy donors. Because synthetic agonists of TLR7 do not induce IFN-α secretion in GEN2.2 cells [14], we used primary pDCs, which permit to assess the effect of AB8779 on both TLR7 and TLR9-mediated cytokine production. As in GEN2.2 cells, AB8779 inhibited production of IFN-α, TNF-α, and IL-6 in primary pDCs stimulated with CpG-A; it inhibited also production of all three cytokines stimulated with synthetic TLR7 agonist R848 (Fig 1C). In sum, Syk inhibition specifically blocked TLR7/9-mediated production of IFN-α and proinflammatory cytokines. 10.1371/journal.pone.0156063.g002\nFig 2 Effect of Syk inhibitor AB8779 on production of IFN-α TNF-α and IL-6 in pDCs.\n(A) Experimental outline. GEN2.2 cells (B), or primary pDC (C) were incubated with different concentrations of Syk inhibitor AB8779 for 1 hr before stimulation with CpG-A, CpG-B and PMA (N = 3) (B), or CpG-A and R848 (N = 2) (C). After 16 hr culture, IFN-α TNF-α and IL-6 production in GEN2.2 cells (B) or in primary pDCs (C) was determined in cell-free supernatants by ELISA and the results expressed as a multiple of control with the matching concentration of DMSO. Subliminal concentrations of Syk inhibitor enhance IFN-α production abrogated by crosslinking of RR by mAbs or by virus particles\nStronger inhibitory effect of AB8779 on Syk (Y525/526) phosphorylation induced by BDCA-2 than that induced by CpG-A (Fig 1D and 1E) suggested that subliminal concentrations of AB8779, which do not inhibit IFN-α production, could alleviate negative effect of BCR-like signaling on IFN-α production. To test this hypothesis, we exposed GEN2.2 cells pretreated with 0.01 μM AB8779 to ILT7 or BDCA-2 mAbs, or HBV or HCV particles, prior to stimulation with CpG-A (Fig 3A). As expected, in the absence of AB8779, IFN-α production was inhibited by RR crosslinking by mAbs or by HCV/HBV viral particles [12, 13, 15, 19–21] (Fig 3B). After standardization to the quantity of IFN-α produced in the absence of AB8779, pretreatment of GEN2.2 cells with 0.01 μM AB8779 significantly enhanced production of IFN-α (Fig 3C). IFN-α production increased in cells treated with ILT7 (1.8-fold, p = 0.03) and BDCA-2 (1.6-fold, p = 0.04), and it showed a tendency to enhanced production by cells treated with HCV particles (1.8-fold at both MOI = 1 and MOI = 3) and with HBV particles (1.8-fold at MOI = 0.5 and 2.3-fold at MOI = 1.3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0156063.g003\nFig 3 Subliminal concentrations of Syk inhibitor partially restore IFN-α production in GEN2.2 pDC cell line.\n(A) Experimental outline. After separation from MS-5 feeder cells, GEN2.2 cells were incubated with 0.01 μM AB8779 or with a matching concentration of DMSO for 1 hr before exposure ILT7 or BDCA-2 mAb or HCV or HBV particles and stimulation with CpG-A. (B) After 16 hr culture, IFN-α production was determined in GEN2.2 cell-free supernatants by ELISA, and the results were standardized to the quantity of IFN-α produced by GEN2.2 exposed to isotype control Ab or mock-infected culture in the absence of AB8779 (N = 3). (C) IFN-α production determined in GEN2.2 exposed to ILT7 or BDCA-2 mAb or HCV or HBV particles (shown in B) was normalized to IFN-α production in the absence of AB8779 *, p ≤0.05; **, p <0.01. Our results demonstrate that Syk is involved in pDCs in both RR and TLR7/9 signaling. While RR BCR-like pathway represents tolerogenic homeostatic functions of pDCs, TLR7/9 –a pattern recognition receptor pathway is responsible for pDC immunogenic activity. Thus, pharmacological targeting of Syk could be a useful tool to suppress overproduction of IFN-I in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis, where pDCs play a critical role during initiation of the disease and are an attractive therapeutic target [4, 5].The role of Syk in TLR signaling has been extensively studied in macrophages/monocytes in the context of the cell membrane localized TLR4 [22–24]. Syk activity is crucial for CD14-dependent endocytosis of TLR4 [22, 23]. Syk-deficient macrophages exhibited decreased TLR4-dependent activation of TBK1 signaling and production of type I IFNs, however, they showed an enhanced activation of TAK1 and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, compared to that in wild-type macrophages. In contrast, the role of Syk in endosomal TLR7/9 signaling is much less understood. Several reports demonstrated that Syk is recruited to TLR9 upon CpG stimulation, and that this interaction can be blocked by Src kinases inhibitors [23–25]. Because membrane-associated Syk is recruited to ITAM-containing receptors, which is not the case of TLR9, it is likely that the TLR9–Syk association is indirect and that other proteins participate in the formation of a complex. This is compatible with different kinetics of Syk phosphorylation in GEN2.2 cells stimulated with TLR7/9 or RR agonists. Our results show that stimulation of TLR or BCR pathway in pDCs leads to phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines Y525/526 that is substantially greater than phosphorylation at Y352 (Fig 1D). A similar observation was made in B cells, where, phosphorylation at Y525/526 was shown to be required for sustained PLC-γ2, Akt and ERK signaling, while phosphorylation at Y352 had a constitutive character [26].Subliminal concentrations of AB8779, which only weakly inhibited production of IFN-α induced by CpG-A, significantly enhanced production of IFN-α blocked by triggering RR pathway. This suggests that concentration of Syk inhibitor that does not block TLR7/9 pathway (≤0.01 μM AB8779) abrogates negative effect of RR BCR-like signaling on IFN-I production. This result is compatible with different sensitivity of Syk to AB8779 upon stimulation of GEN2.2 cells with TLR7/9 or RR agonists (Fig 1D and 1E); it suggests presence of different pools of Syk in pDCs, one controlling TLR7/9 and the other controlling RR pathway. Restoration of immunogenic activity by pharmacological targeting of Syk is of special interest in the case of pDCs exposed to HBV and HCV particles, where ligation of RR with viruses represents one of the immune escape mechanisms [7, 11–13, 15, 19, 20]. While in the era of the great success of direct acting antivirals against HIV and HCV, stimulation of IFN response might represent an adjuvant therapy, namely important in the case of the virus escape, induction of IFN-I in combination with existing antivirals may cure HBV infection [27]."],"thought_2":["IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced expression of chemokines by bronchial epithelial cells\nFirst, to evaluate chemokine production by airway epithelial cells treated with IL-17A and/or poly(I:C), we comprehensively investigated chemokine expression by BEAS-2B cells using a chemokine array (Fig 1A). In densitometry, stimulation with IL-17A resulted in modest induction of several chemokines, such as GRO, CXCL1, and CC chemokine ligand (CCL)1, but no chemokine underwent a more than three-fold increase compared to the control. Stimulation with poly(I:C) upregulated several chemokines by more than threefold compared to the control group, including GRO, CXCL1, CCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL5 (light-blue cells in Fig 1B). Among those chemokines, co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) induced more than three-fold upregulation of signals for GRO, CXCL1 and CXCL8 (gray cells in Fig 1B) compared with poly(I:C) stimulation. Table 3 shows the detailed densitometry data for the chemokine array. 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g001\nFig 1 Comprehensive analysis of cytokine and chemokine production by BEAS-2B cells.\nBEAS-2B cells were stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL) for 24 h. The supernatants were collected and analyzed for cytokine and chemokine production using a cytokine/chemokine protein array. (A) The membranes, representative for each treatment (stimulation) group, show the protein signals detected. (B) The array mapping is shown. Cells colored light blue are chemokines that were upregulated more than three-fold in the poly(I:C) stimulation group compared with the control group. Cells colored gray are chemokines that were upregulated more than three-fold in the co-stimulation group compared with the poly(I:C) group.

The evaluated chemokines are listed in the left column. The relative ratios of IL-17A, poly(I:C), and co-stimulation to the control are shown, and italic type indicates more than a three-fold increase. The relative ratios of co-stimulation to poly(I:C) are listed in the right-most column, and bold type indicates more than a three-fold increase. Next, we used qRT-PCR and ELISA to validate the effects of stimulation with IL-17A and/or poly(I:C) on CXCL8 mRNA expression and CXCL8 production by BEAS-2B cells and NHBE cells. IL-17A induced modest CXCL8 mRNA expression by BEAS-2B cells (7.2-fold compared with the control) (Fig 2A). Poly(I:C) induced strong CXCL8 mRNA expression, as reported by others [20, 21]. As shown in Fig 2A and 2B, co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL8 mRNA expression and CXCL8 production by BEAS-2B cells (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). Similar results were generated in NHBE cells (Fig 2C and 2D). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g002\nFig 2 Chemokine production by BEAS-2B and NHBE cells.\n(A) BEAS-2B cells were stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL) for 6 h, and then CXCL8 mRNA expression was investigated. IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL8 mRNA expression. (B) BEAS-2B cells were stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL) for 24 h, and then the CXCL8 protein concentration was determined by ELISA. IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL8 protein production by BEAS-2B cells. (C) NHBE cells were treated in the same manner as the BEAS-2B cells in (A), and then CXCL8 mRNA expression was investigated. IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL8 mRNA expression. (D) NHBE cells were treated in the same manner as the BEAS-2B cells in (B), and then the CXCL8 protein concentration was evaluated. IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL8 protein production. (E) BEAS-2B cells were treated in the same manner in (A) and then evaluated for CXCL1 mRNA expression.

IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL1 mRNA expression. (H) NHBE cells were treated in the same manner in (D), and then the CXCL1 protein concentration was evaluated. IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced CXCL1 protein production.*: p < 0.05, compared to poly(I:C), Tukey—Kramer’s HSD. n = 3 independent experiments. We similarly validated mRNA expression and protein production for CXCL1. IL-17A and poly(I:C) co-stimulation also synergistically induced CXCL1 mRNA expression and protein production in both BEAS-2B and NHBE cells (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA) (Fig 2E–2H). Poly(I:C) induced chemokine expression via TLR3/TRIF-mediated signals\nTo investigate the mechanism of the synergistic effect of co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C), we evaluated various intracellular signaling pathways.\nFirst, we used three siRNAs targeting TLR3 to assess whether BEAS-2B cells responded to poly(I:C) through TLR3 signaling. We confirmed that transfection of BEAS-2B cells with the siRNAs for TLR3 caused clear downregulation of TLR3 mRNA and protein levels (Fig 3A and 3B). Next, we examined the effects of the siRNAs for TLR3 on chemokine production by BEAS-2B cells treated with poly(I:C). TLR3 knockdown significantly inhibited mRNA expression for the CXCL8 and CXCL1 chemokines (Fig 3C). Then, we also evaluated the signaling via TRIF, a key adaptor for TLR3, using the siRNA targeting TRIF. The siRNA clearly inhibited TRIF mRNA expression and protein production (Fig 3D and 3E). Further, TRIF knockdown significantly inhibited mRNA expression of the CXCL8 and CXCL1 chemokines by BEAS-2B cells treated with poly(I:C) (Fig 3F). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g003\nFig 3 Effects of TLR3 and TRIF siRNA on chemokine mRNA expression.\nBEAS-2B cells were transfected with three siRNAs targeting TLR3 (#1–#3). After 72 h, qRT-PCR (A) and Western blot (B) were used to evaluate the knockdown efficacy of each siRNA. All siRNAs for TLR3 abolished TLR3 mRNA expression and protein production in the cells. (C) BEAS-2B cells were transfected with two of the siRNAs targeting TLR3 (#2, #3) that had exhibited marked inhibition of TLR3 expression in (A). After 72 h, the cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL), and 6 h later they were evaluated for CXCL8 and CXCL1 mRNA expression. Both TLR3 siRNAs significantly decreased the mRNA expression of those chemokines. BEAS-2B cells were transfected with three siRNAs targeting TRIF (#1–#3). After 72 h, qRT-PCR (D) and Western blot (E) were used to evaluate the knockdown efficacy of each siRNA. All siRNAs for TRIF abolished TRIF mRNA expression and protein production in the cells. (F) BEAS-2B cells were transfected with two of the siRNAs targeting TRIF (#1, #3) that had exhibited marked inhibition of TRIF expression in (D). Then, cells were treated in the same manner as in (C) and evaluated for CXCL8 and CXCL1 mRNA expression. Both TRIF siRNAs significantly decreased mRNA expression for those chemokines. *: p < 0.05, compared to the negative control. n = 3 independent experiments. NC, negative control. Co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) promoted phosphorylation of p38, Erk 1/2 and IκBα in BEAS-2B cells\nWe next evaluated the contribution of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways to CXCL8 production. First, we investigated the phosphorylation of MAPK and IκBα. Co-stimulation of BEAS-2B cells with IL-17A and poly(I:C) induced phosphorylation of each of p38, Erk 1/2 and IκBα (Fig 4A and 4B), but not JNK (Fig 4C). Because the phosphorylations of p38 and Erk 1/2 were distinctive, we evaluated the effects of IL-17A and/or poly(I:C) on them in BEAS-2B cells. We found strong induction of p38 and Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in the co-stimulation group (Fig 4A), whereas the induction by IL-17A stimulation was negligible. Next, we examined the effects of MAPK inhibitors (SB203580, U0126 and SP600125) and an IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor (BAY11-7082) on CXCL8 protein production by BEAS-2B cells. SB203580, U0126 and BAY11-7082 each significantly inhibited CXCL8 protein production by BEAS-2B cells stimulated with both IL-17A and poly(I:C). On the other hand, SP600125 showed no inhibition and induced significantly greater production (Fig 5). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g004\nFig 4 Induction of MAPK/NF-κB signaling in BEAS-2B cells by IL-17A and poly(I:C).\n(A) BEAS-2B cells were stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL). Cell lysates were prepared after 0, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min to assess phosphorylation of p38 and Erk 1/2. IL-17A alone induced only slight phosphorylation of p38 and Erk 1/2. Poly(I:C) alone induced phosphorylation of p38 and Erk 1/2 for up to 15 min. Both p38 and Erk 1/2 were more strongly phosphorylated in the co-stimulation group compared with the single-stimulation groups. In the co-stimulation group, p38 was phosphorylated for up to 15 min, and Erk 1/2 was phosphorylated in delayed fashion compared to p38. (B) BEAS-2B cells were co-stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL). Cell lysates were prepared after 0, 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min to assess phosphorylation of IκBα. IL-17A plus poly(I:C) induced IκBα phosphorylation for up to 15 min. (C) BEAS-2B cells were co-stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL), and cell lysates were prepared at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after stimulation to assess phosphorylation of JNK. Unlike p38 and Erk 1/2, no induction of JNK phosphorylation was detected. 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g005\nFig 5 Effects of MAPK inhibitors and IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor on CXCL8 production.\nBEAS-2B cells were pretreated with inhibitor 1 h before stimulation with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL). After 24 h, CXCL8 production was evaluated by ELISA of culture supernatants. Inhibitors of p38 (SB203580) and Erk 1/2 (U0126) significantly inhibited CXCL8 production by cells co-treated with IL-17A and poly(I:C), as did an IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor (BAY11-7082). On the other hand, a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) showed no inhibition. *: p < 0.05, compared to no inhibitor. n = 3 independent experiments. Transcriptional activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by co-stimulation did not differ greatly from that by poly(I:C) alone\nWe used a luciferase reporter assay to evaluate the activity of transcriptional factors—including NF-κB and AP-1—that are usually associated with inflammatory cytokine production induced by TLR stimulation. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB was significantly augmented by co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) compared with the control and IL-17A alone, although there was no statistically significant difference between co-stimulation and poly(I:C) alone (Fig 6A). Nuclear translocation of NF-κB in co-stimulation also did not differ greatly from that with poly(I:C) alone (Fig 6B). The transcriptional activity of AP-1 was not augmented by the co-stimulation (Fig 6A). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g006\nFig 6 Effects of IL-17A and poly(I:C) on transcription-driven luciferase activity and NF-κB nuclear translocation.\nWe transfected BEAS-2B cells with a plasmid containing luciferase as a reporter gene, controlled by a synthetic promoter containing the NF-κB or AP-1 response element. At 48 h post-transfection, we stimulated the cells with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL). TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and PMA (10 ng/mL) were added as positive controls for NF-κB and AP-1, respectively. The activity of NF-κB was significantly augmented by co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C), compared with the control and IL-17A alone, but there was no statistically significant difference between poly(I:C) alone and co-stimulation. The co-stimulation did not augment the activity of AP-1. *: p < 0.05, compared to poly(I:C). n = 9 independent experiments for NF-κB; n = 3 independent experiments for AP-1. (B) To evaluate NF-κB nuclear translocation, BEAS-2B cells were stimulated with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL) for 1 h, and then a nuclear extract was prepared. There was no apparent difference in nuclear translocation between the poly(I:C) alone and co-stimulation groups. IL-17A promoted the stability of CXCL8 mRNA\nFinally, we performed an actinomycin D chase study to investigate whether the chemokine upregulation was due in part to a post-transcriptional effect of IL-17A. Even after addition of actinomycin D, the BEAS-2B cell group co-stimulated with IL-17A and poly(I:C) showed a continuously high level of CXCL8 mRNA expression compared with the poly(I:C) alone group, as shown in Fig 7A. There was a significant difference in AUC between the co-stimulation group and poly(I:C) alone group (79.0 ± 4.3 vs. 48.8 ± 6.0, p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the co-stimulation group and poly(I:C) alone group in the level of CXCL1 mRNA at each time point and AUC (120.5 ± 10.0 vs. 132.8 ± 12.8) after the addition of actinomycin D (Fig 7B). This result suggested that IL-17A induced prolonged CXCL8 mRNA expression through mRNA stabilization. 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g007\nFig 7 Post-transcriptional effect of IL-17A on chemokine production.\nTo investigate the post-transcriptional effect of IL-17A, BEAS-2B cells were treated with actinomycin D 3 h after stimulation with poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL) with/without IL-17A (100 ng/mL). We plotted expression of CXCL8 and CXCL1 mRNA at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after actinomycin D addition. (A) The IL-17A and poly(I:C) co-stimulation group showed a continuously high level of CXCL8 mRNA expression even after actinomycin D addition, compared with the poly(I:C) alone group. (B) There was no significant difference in the level of CXCL1 mRNA after addition of actinomycin D in two groups. *: p < 0.05, compared to poly(I:C) alone. n = 3 independent experiments. We evaluated chemokine production by bronchial epithelial cells and the mechanisms underlying their production, including intracellular signaling and mRNA stability. Our aim was to clarify the pathogenesis of viral-infection-triggered exacerbation of chronic inflammatory diseases. We found that co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced mRNA expression and protein production of CXCL8 and CXCL1 by BEAS-2B cells and NHBE cells. Poly(I:C) induced chemokine expression by BEAS-2B cells mainly via TLR3/TRIF-mediated signals. Co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) markedly activated the p38 and Erk 1/2 pathways, although there was little difference in NF-κB translocation into the nucleus or the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and AP-1 compared with the poly(I:C)-only group. Furthermore, IL-17A promoted stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA in BEAS-2B cells treated with poly(I:C).IL-17A was reported to be highly expressed in lung tissues of patients with chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases compared with healthy persons, and to be associated with lung function decline [22, 23]. IL-17A is suggested to play a key role in neutrophilic inflammation. Neutrophils in the airway are known to be associated with the severity level and treatment-resistant status of chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases [24–26]. Previous studies showed that IL-17A induced production of neutrophil chemoattractants—such as CXCL8, CXCL1 and CXCL6—by bronchial epithelial cells via the p38 and Erk 1/2 pathways [27–29]. Among neutrophil chemoattractants, CXCL8 is a key mediator of neutrophil recruitment, and CXCL8 expression in the airways of patients with chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases is correlated with the neutrophil count and treatment-resistant status. In addition, the expressions of IL-17A and CXCL8 in the sputum of asthmatic patients are correlated [30]. In chronic inflammatory respiratory disease patients, acute exacerbation is a highly refractory status and a cause of high mortality, and its frequency usually increases with disease severity. Acute exacerbation is triggered mainly by infection. Various inflammatory cells and mediators are involved in acute exacerbation. Among such inflammatory cells and mediators, increased neutrophils and CXCL8 in the airway are characteristic of acute exacerbation [10–16]. Here, we demonstrated that IL-17A and poly(I:C) synergistically induced such neutrophil chemoattractants as CXCL1 and CXCL8, although IL-17A alone induced only modest production. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-17A may be associated with the pathogenesis of viral-infection-triggered exacerbation by promoting release of neutrophil chemoattractants from bronchial epithelial cells.We also investigated the mechanisms of intracellular signaling and mRNA stability. Previous studies indicated that the involvement of IL-17A in inflammation is mediated mainly through a heterodimeric receptor complex of IL-17 receptor A and IL-17 receptor C, which is expressed ubiquitously [31, 32]. On the other hand, dsRNA induces intracellular signals not only via TLR3 but also via other receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase [33, 34]. The siRNAs targeting those three receptors did not significantly inhibit the expression of chemokines, including CXCL8, by airway epithelial cells stimulated with poly(I:C) [35]. Therefore, our results suggest that poly(I:C) induces chemokine production mainly via TLR3-mediated signals. However, the siRNA for TLR3 did not inhibit chemokine production completely, so some other pathways may exist. We also evaluated the role of TRIF, which is a key adaptor for TLR3, using the siRNA targeting TRIF [36]. The siRNA for TRIF clearly inhibited the expression of chemokines by BEAS-2B cells treated with poly(I:C). Taken together, it was thought that poly(I:C) induced chemokine production mainly via the TLR3/TRIF pathway. We next investigated the involvement of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. First, we found that signaling via the p38 and Erk 1/2 pathways was crucial for the synergistically enhanced chemokine production by bronchial epithelial cells co-stimulated with IL-17A and poly(I:C). Our results suggest that the NF-κB pathway is not responsible for that synergistic effect of chemokine production.IL-17A was reported to enhance chemokine gene expression through mRNA stabilization in various cell/stimulation systems [37–39]. Our actinomycin D chase experiments showed that IL-17A enhanced stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA in BEAS-2B cells stimulated with poly(I:C). Based on that result, we focused especially on the p38 and Erk 1/2 pathways, because inhibition of their phosphorylation markedly abolished the synergistic CXCL8 production. Previous studies showed that single stimulation by IL-17A or poly(I:C) induced chemokines via p38 and Erk1/2 pathways [28, 29, 40]. Our result showed that co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) induced markedly stronger phosphorylation compared with the single stimulation group. We suspected that several factors at the juncture of p38 and Erk 1/2 downstream were associated with this mechanism. Therefore, we examined whether factors such as MK2, MAPK-interacting kinase 1/2, and mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase 1/2—which play important roles in transcription and mRNA stabilization downstream of p38—were involved in the synergistic chemokine production. Contrary to our expectation, inhibition of the activity of those molecules did not significantly affect CXCL8 production (Fig 8). Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-17A promotes chemokine production by bronchial epithelial cells treated with poly(I:C) mainly via the p38 and Erk 1/2 pathways in collaboration with mRNA stabilization. Besides these factors, we hypothesize the existence of some interaction of p38 and Erk 1/2 signaling with unknown factors downstream of p38 and Erk 1/2 (Fig 9).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g008\nFig 8 Effects of inhibitors on CXCL8 protein production.\nBEAS-2B cells were pretreated with inhibitor 1 h before stimulation with IL-17A (100 ng/mL) and/or poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/mL). After 24 h, CXCL8 production was evaluated by ELISA of culture supernatants. None of the inhibitors (MK2 inhibitor III, ETP45835 or SB747651A) significantly inhibited CXCL8 protein production by BEAS-2B cells co-stimulated with IL-17A and poly(I:C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141746.g009\nFig 9 Hypothetical schematic summary of induction of chemokine production by IL-17A and poly(I:C).\nPoly(I:C) induces chemokines mainly via the TLR3/TRIF pathway.

Myoblast proliferation is a critical step in the growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle. The precise action of inorganic arsenic on myoblast growth has not been investigated. Here, we investigated the in vitro effect of inorganic arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on the growth of C2C12 myoblasts. As2O3 decreased myoblast growth at submicromolar concentrations (0.25–1 μM) after 72 h of treatment. Submicromolar concentrations of As2O3 did not induce the myoblast apoptosis. Low-concentration As2O3 (0.5 and 1 μM) significantly suppressed the myoblast cell proliferative activity, which was accompanied by a small proportion of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expression. As2O3 (0.5 and 1 μM) increased the intracellular arsenic content but did not affect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the myoblasts. Cell cycle analysis indicated that low-concentrations of As2O3 inhibited cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest in the G1 and G2/M phases. As2O3 also decreased the protein expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, and CDK4, but did not affect the protein expressions of p21 and p27. Furthermore, As2O3 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt. Insulin-like growth factor-1 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of As2O3 on Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation in the myoblasts. These results suggest that submicromolar concentrations of As2O3 alter cell cycle progression and reduce myoblast proliferation, at least in part, through a ROS-independent Akt inhibition pathway."],"thought_2":["Plumbagin, a quinonoid found in the plants of the Plumbaginaceae, possesses medicinal properties. In this study we investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity of plumbagin by using two human colonic cancer cell lines, HT29 and HCT15. IC50 of Plumbagin for HCT15 and HT29 cells (22.5 µM and 62.5 µM, respectively) were significantly different. To study the response of cancer cells during treatment strategies, cells were treated with two different concentrations, 15 µM, 30 µM for HCT15 and 50 µM, 75 µM for HT29 cells. Though activation of NFκB, Caspases-3, elevated levels of TNF-α, cytosolic Cytochrome C were seen in both HCT15 cells HT29 treated with plumbagin, aberrant apoptosis with decreased level of pEGFR, pAkt, pGsk-3β, PCNA and Cyclin D1was observed only in 15 µM and 30 µM plumbagin treated HCT15 and 75 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells. This suggests that plumbagin induces apoptosis in both HCT15 cells and HT29 treated, whereas, proliferation was inhibited only in 15 µM and 30 µM plumbagin treated HCT15 and 75 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells, but not in 50 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells. Expression of COX-2 was decreased in 75 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells when compared to 50 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells, whereas HCT15 cells lack COX. Hence the observed resistance to induction of apoptosis in 50 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells are attributed to the expression of COX-2. In conclusion, plumbagin induces apoptosis in colonic cancer cells through TNF-α mediated pathway depending on expression of COX-2 expression."],"prob":["cell, apoptosi, effect, treat, inhibit, treatment, induc"],"frex":["caspas, apoptot, apoptosi, cyclin, annexin, parp, bbr"],"lift":["triptolid, shikonin, pan-caspas, g2-m, u2o, celastrol, as2o3"],"score":["cell, apoptosi, µm, apoptot, caspas, akt, inhibit"],"proportion":["0.01"]},{"name":["endometri, erα, autophagi, zebrafish, gbm, aqp5, glioma"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[76],"thought_1":["Aquaporin 5 Plays a Role in Estrogen-Induced Ectopic Implantation of Endometrial Stromal Cells in Endometriosis"],"thought_2":["Nicotinate-Curcumin Impedes Foam Cell Formation from THP-1 Cells through Restoring Autophagy Flux"],"prob":["er, ovarian, tumour, embryo, autophagi, glioma, gbm"],"frex":["endometri, erα, autophagi, zebrafish, gbm, aqp5, glioma"],"lift":["tsc2, erα, aqp5, tsc1, endometriot, lc3-ii, atf6"],"score":["ovarian, er, autophagi, tumour, glioma, embryo, gbm"],"proportion":["0"]}],"topic_no":[67,76]},{"name":["mirna, microrna, microarray, signatur, exosom, mir, transcript"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[53],"thought_1":["Microarray Expression Data Identify DCC as a Candidate Gene for Early Meningioma Progression"],"thought_2":["Co-expression analysis has been employed to predict gene function, identify functional modules, and determine tumor subtypes. Previous co-expression analysis was mainly conducted at bulk tissue level. It is unclear whether co-expression analysis at the single-cell level will provide novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here we developed a computational approach to compare glioblastoma expression profiles at the single-cell level with those obtained from bulk tumors. We found that the co-expressed genes observed in single cells and bulk tumors have little overlap and show distinct characteristics. The co-expressed genes identified in bulk tumors tend to have similar biological functions, and are enriched for intrachromosomal interactions with synchronized promoter activity. In contrast, single-cell co-expressed genes are enriched for known protein-protein interactions, and are regulated through interchromosomal interactions. Moreover, gene members of some protein complexes are co-expressed only at the bulk level, while those of other complexes are co-expressed at both single-cell and bulk levels. Finally, we identified a set of co-expressed genes that can predict the survival of glioblastoma patients. Our study highlights that comparative analyses of single-cell and bulk gene expression profiles enable us to identify functional modules that are regulated at different levels and hold great translational potential.\nAuthor Summary: With the development of single-cell sequencing, an increasing number of biological insights were revealed at the single-cell resolution. Here we integrated the expression profiles from single cells and bulk tissues to discover that a majority of gene pairs were specifically co-expressed at single-cell and bulk levels. Our comparative analysis reveals co-expressed functional modules at different levels, and suggests a distinct regulatory mechanism in which single-cell co-expressed genes are regulated through physical interactions from different chromosomes. Moreover, we found a set of co-expressed genes to predict patient survival.
